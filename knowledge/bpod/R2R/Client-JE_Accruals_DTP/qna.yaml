  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The objective  of SBT - accrual process is to ensure that the capital
      spend is recorded in the same period when it occurs, even if the project fails
      to be capitalized by the end of the month.
    question: What is the objective of SBT - accrual process?
  - answer: The SBT accrual process is performed monthly, typically on WD03.
    question: How often is the SBT accrual process performed?
  - answer: 'The required system accesses are PeopleSoft Financials and M: Drive.'
    question: What system accesses are required for the SBT accrual process?
- context: "5.  #  Process Detail \n\n    1.  ## Overview\n\n> If there is any project\

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The IBM Fixed Asset Associate runs a PeopleSoft query to obtain the list
      of projects that failed to be capitalized.
    question: How does the IBM Fixed Asset Associate obtain the list of projects that
      failed to be capitalized?
  - answer: 'The steps to update the SBT PCCACR Master excel file and prepare the
      journal entry are:

      1.  Update the WD1 line item** in the ZI_SBT_PAC_AM_STATUS_NOT_DIST tab.

      2.  Update the line item details into the JE template accordingly.  Debit 32110
      (Cost account) and Credit 24542 (CIP account).

      3.  Upload the journal entry into PeopleSoft using the journal upload tool.'
    question: What are the steps to update the SBT PCCACR Master excel file and prepare
      the journal entry?
  - answer: When creating SBT PCCACR Master Excel file, after running the PeopleSoft
      query, the report will open in Excel, and you need to go to the Acctg Date column
      and filter WD1 date to check if any line item is found on WD1 date. If yes,
      then book an accrual entry.
    question: When creating SBT PCCACR Master Excel file, what is the next step after
      running the PeopleSoft query?
