- context: '-   **3PSP calculates and 3PSP posts (Template 3**) -- is used for journal
    entries calculated, prepared and approved by Service Provider; these journal entries
    are calculated by the Service Provider based on the predefined list and rules
    set up by Client on a yearly basis (the journals are processed by the Service
    Provider, including e.g. accrual for borrowings interests'' costs, payroll costs,
    advertising expenses, promotion expenses),

    -   Reversal (Template 4) -- is used to reverse journal entries, that were not
    marked as reversible during the initial approval process (the approval for reversal
    entry is given as per TOA).

    > All templates except Template 4, can be used to post reversible and non-reversible
    journals. The same templates can be used for setting up the recurring entries.

    > The restatement postings, which are mirror postings to main entry (initial entry
    is the judgmental entry based on calculation and info received from Central Team)
    are posted by the Service Provider. As the knowledge about the values is based
    on data calculated by Central Teams (UBMS) and the Service Provider is not able
    to explain the figures - in line with current GPM - it should be posted by UL
    (not by the Service Provider).

    > However, due to fact that those restatements need to mirror the initial posting
    only, and no further judgment is required - it is still expected to be posted
    by the Service Provider.

    > If journals or accruals related to tax or payroll with clearly defined rules,
    are calculated and prepared by the Service Provider, they are considered as non-judgmental
    postings. The payroll-related entries, even if classified as judgmental, can be
    initiated and posted by the Service Provider.

    **Note**: All TB transfers from one ERP to another, that are performed in the
    form of journal entry, can be treated as an exception from the reversing journals.
    These transfers are not typical accrual journals, but the entire TB is being transferred
    from non-SAP to SAP, as there is no direct interface.

    > The number of manual accruals recognized should be limited due to the Client
    policy "No PO, no pay" which means that all purchases apart from a few exceptions
    listed in the Client policy have to be made based on Purchase Orders.

    > **Note**: There is following special requirement regarding the intercompany
    175\*-176\* series. All postings to be processed as non-reversible entries and
    are subject to additional approval of IC Ops Hub prior to posting.

    > When doing cross company journals, ensure the entry is netting to zero at Legal
    entity level. You should not post cross journals which are not balancing to zero
    at LE level using journals workflow and it must follow the Intercompany processes.'

      about values calculated by Central Teams (UBMS) and should be posted by UL (not
      by the Service Provider), it is still expected that the Service Provider will
      post these entries, as they only need to mirror the initial posting without
      requiring further judgment.

      series in the journal entry process?
