      31. Open the 'Recap' Tab, check and remove the blank rows including the
      total and select all the data sort the with the package as below.

      32. Navigate to the new sheet tab where pasted the Package total amounts select the 'Package' Column and click on the Text to columnsfixed withselect the column before the totalNextNextfinishclick on Ok to remove 'total' word from package.

      33. Navigate to the 'Recap' Tab and apply Vlookup formula as shown below by providing the

      > correct input.

      a.  The Lookup_value is in column B (the unique package number)

      b.  The Table_array is columns A through C from the 'Sheet 1' tab(as per the screen below).

      c.  The Col_index_num is 3 from the 'Sheet 1' tab. (The corresponding package number is in the third column of the 'Sheet 1' tab.)

      34. The Range_lookup value is 'false' so that only exact matches are returned and drag to the end of the rows to apply the formula so that it will reflect most of the packages are updated with amounts and paste special values to remove the formula and apply 'Round' formula for(upto 2 digits) the same amount column.

      35. Verify that all of the package totals from the 'Sheet1' tab are properly reflected on the Recap tab as a result of the VLOOKUP. Some packages have "a" and "b" suffixes and the VLOOKUP will not return those balances; they will need to be added manually. Make changes as necessary and ensure ALL "N/A"s are gone from Column E. (Some packages on the Recap tab may not have any current activity in HFM and therefore should have a zero balance manually input on the Recap tab).

      36. After the Recap tab is completely populated and all balances are accounted for, the ending balance on the Recap should match the ending balance on the Grid. If there are any mismatches, then it would be say PKGNONE, which are due to invalid relationships.

      37. Based on the Package and relationship account copy and paste in the Grid Recap file in the Recap Tab also copy and paste the amount and description at the end apply sum in Grand total to get the amount matched.

      38. Select all the lines in the 'Recap' tab(not the PKGNONE in the below)Filter itIn the relationship header click on the dropdownFilter with NC2Ok

      39. When the only the NC2 list populated apply Uniq colour to filter.
