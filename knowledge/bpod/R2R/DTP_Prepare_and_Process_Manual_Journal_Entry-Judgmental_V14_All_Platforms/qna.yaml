  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of Control RTR C2.20?
    answer: The purpose of Control RTR C2.20 is to ensure that all journal entries
      are approved or authorized by the client, complete and accurate, and to detect
      manual errors that may occur when the journal entry is entered.
  - question: How often is Control RTR C2.20 executed?
    answer: Control RTR C2.20 is executed event-driven, meaning it is triggered by
      a specific event, such as the approval of a journal entry.
  - question: What is the benefit of Control RTR C2.20?
    answer: The benefit of Control RTR C2.20 is that it **enables the identification
      of manual errors prior to posting**, ensuring that all journal entries are accurate
      and complete before being processed into SAP.
- context: '> **Exception for RUB countries**: All the judgmental entries are to be
    prepared, posted and approved by UL (not PSP). This rule does not apply for RUB
    countries.

    > For those countries exceptional treatment is agreed:

    > All the judgmental entries which are calculated and prepared by MCO, but sent
    to CG for posting in Trintech will be treated as judgmental entries, with full
    ownership in MCO. Dedicated persons from CG team, who will be posting the entries
    mentioned above, will be removed from the current non-judgmental TOA in Trintech
    and assigned to the UL (judgmental) TOA, with proper UL approvers assigned --
    WL2, WL3 and WL4, based on the global thresholds. Separate tracker/list will be
    kept by CG team for these entries, updated monthly with document numbers and shared
    with MCO for audit and control purposes.

    > There are following accounting areas which may result in a need for Manual Journal
    Entry/Accrual posting:


    -   All Record and Account entries: Fixed Assets, Capital Project, Cost Accounting,
    Inventory Accounting, Sales Accounting, Treasury payments


    -   Pre-defined or not Period Close Entries: journals, prepayments, provisions,
    accruals, foreign exchange adjustments, tax reporting


    -   Reconciliations: Trial Balance Reconciliations (incl. reconciliations of Sub-Ledgers

    > As a rule all journals should be processed in Cadency Journal Entry Tool (Trintech).
    There are four main templates defined to standardize journal entries posting using
    Cadency Journal Entry Tool:


    a)  Judgmental/Non Judgmental Accrual -- for posting Accrual entries including
    a reversal date and a reversal reason, which are reversed in the following period


    b)  Judgmental/Non Judgmental Non-Accrual -- designated to post Non-Accrual entries
    which do not need any reversal at period ends


    c)  AR/ Customer Journal- designated to post GL Accounts to Customer accounts
    by using proper posting keys, which are aligned with SAP


    d)  AP/ Vendor Journal -- designated to post GL Accounts to Vendor accounts by
    using proper posting keys, which are aligned with SAP


    **Note**: All TB transfers from one ERP to another, that are performed in the
    form of journal entry, can be treated as an exception from the reversing journals.
    These transfers are not typical accrual journals, but the entire TB is being transferred
    from non-SAP to SAP, as there is no direct interface.'
