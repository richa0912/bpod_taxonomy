- context: "## 1.2 Business Context \n\n> The following types of entries are distinguished\
    \ depending on the process of their calculation and preparation:\n\na)  Automated\
    \ -- recognition, calculation and posting are initiated by the ERP system, including\
    \ amongst others: accrual for stock/non-stock items received but invoiced (based\
    \ on open POs with goods/services received but no invoice received), accrual for\
    \ discounts agreed to customers etc.\n\nb)  **Manual** - of which recognition,\
    \ calculation and posting is initiated by Service Provider or by Client in the\
    \ journal workflow tool\\*\n\n> \\* in rare cases due to system limitations Manual\
    \ Entry can be performed directly in SAP\n>\n> Journals can be classified as either\
    \ Judgmental or Non-judgmental as per their ownership and approval methodology:\n\
    \na.  Judgmental Journals require business knowledge as some judgement is needed\
    \ to ensure that the amounts involved are correct. The Country or Supply Chain\
    \ Company Finance is responsible for their initiation and approval.\n\nb.  **Non-Judgmental\
    \ Journals** do not require detailed business knowledge and the steps to prepare\
    \ and post the journals are explicitly explained in the respective end-to-end\
    \ working instructions, which is applicable for any type of journal entry. These\
    \ can then be processed repeatedly without any judgement involved. Booking is\
    \ initiated on the regular basis (at the period end) by the Service Provider based\
    \ on the predefined list and rules set up by Client. These are hence under the\
    \ responsibility of 3^rd^ Party Service Provider for initiation and approval.\n\
    \n> As a rule, all journals should be processed in journal workflow tool. There\
    \ are four main templates defined to standardize journal entries posting process.\
    \ Each template defines the responsibilities for preparation and approval steps\
    \ for Journal, Accrual or Provision entry:\n\n-   UL calculates and UL posts (Template\
    \ 1) -- is used for journal entries calculated, prepared and approved by Client,\n\
    \n-   UL calculates and 3PSP posts (Template 2) -- is used for journal entries\
    \ calculated by Client, forwarded to Service Provider to prepare the journal in\
    \ the journal workflow tool, then approved by the initial UL requestor and finally\
    \ reviewed by Client (the reviewer must have the proper authorization level as\
    \ per TOA),"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The two types of journal entries based on the process of their calculation
      and preparation are: 1.  Automated: recognition, calculation, and posting are
      initiated by the ERP system. 2.  Manual: recognition, calculation, and posting
      are initiated by the Service Provider or by Client in the journal workflow tool.'
    question: What are the two types of journal entries based on the process of their
      calculation and preparation?
  - answer: 'The four main templates to standardize journal entries posting process
      are: 1.  UL calculates and UL posts (Template 1): used for journal entries calculated,
      prepared, and approved by Client. 2.  UL calculates and 3PSP posts (Template
      2): used for journal entries calculated by Client, forwarded to Service Provider
      to prepare the journal in the journal workflow tool, then approved by the initial
      UL requestor and finally reviewed by Client. 3.  3PSP calculates and 3PSP posts
      (Template 3): not mentioned in the provided text. 4.  3PSP calculates and UL
      posts (Template 4): not mentioned in the provided text.'
    question: What are the four main templates defined to standardize journal entries
      posting process?
  - answer: Judgmental Journals require business knowledge and judgment to ensure
      that the amounts involved are correct, while Non-Judgmental Journals do not
      require detailed business knowledge and can be processed repeatedly without
      any judgment involved.
    question: What is the difference between Judgmental and Non-Judgmental Journals?
