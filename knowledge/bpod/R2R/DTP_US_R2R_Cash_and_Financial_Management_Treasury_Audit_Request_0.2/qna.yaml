- context: '## Step Description

    Audit support process includes (but not limited to) fetching of journal entries
    & wire transfers on the basis of a request received. The request is mostly received
    from Heather Murray or internal/external auditors.

    The two basic things which are reviewed in case of a wire include the backup document
    for a wire & ensuring that the person who signed off was authorized to do the
    same.

    Approval matrix contains the names of the person authorized to sign off, along
    with their respective authority limits

    To open the Approval matrix, use the following path

    My documents>Misc Folder>Research Folder>MM-YY folder>Approval Matrix File

    The approval matrix is also available on the intranet. The approval matrix gets
    updated on a weekly basis.

    The link for getting the file from intranet is as follows

    The most important column to be used from the approval matrix is the column stating
    Check requests and wire transfers & the column for statutory payments

    For example, to find out the name of the person who can approve the wire transfer
    of amount up to \$200,000, click on the filter applied on check request & wire
    transfers column

    Select all the options having \$ 200,000

    The report displays the name of all the persons who can approve the wire transfers
    up to \$ 200,000 for different regions
    In response to the request received in relation to the wire transfers & journal
    entries, the hard copy of the backup documents is provided.
    An example of the order request received from the auditors is shown below
    The request includes the date, amount & description of the wire
    To open the file containing the details of all the wire transfers made in a month,
    use the following path
    Shared Drive>Treasury>Current Month>MM-YY cash file>Cash Disbursements tab
    This file is kept as a tracker for reference purposes to find out the details
    of all the wire transfers made in a month
    The current process involves finding out the back up document/hard copies for
    all the audit requests & providing a xerox copy to the person from whom the request
    is received. All wire requests should be saved on the Treasury analyst''s email
    archive.'
