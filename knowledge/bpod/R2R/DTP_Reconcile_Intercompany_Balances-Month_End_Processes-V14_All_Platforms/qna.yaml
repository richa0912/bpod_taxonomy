  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The objective of the Simplified Reconciliation approach is to reconcile
      intercompany balances via a newly built Excel Macro tool, specifically for post-period
      end closing intercompany Concern Receivables and Concern Payables balances.
    question: What is the objective of the Simplified Reconciliation approach in the
      intercompany reconciliation process?
  - answer: The IC Hub team is responsible for ensuring the data is fetched correctly
      from respective ECC Systems and uploaded into the Macro tool.
    question: Who is responsible for ensuring the data is fetched correctly from respective
      ECC Systems and uploaded into the Macro tool?
  - answer: The purpose of Control RTR C3.3 is to ensure reconciliation of intercompany
      accounts, specifically to perform intercompany reconciliations, identify and
      investigate differences, and resolve remaining mismatches in accordance with
      GCAD defined threshold and frequency.

    \ books of the issuing and the receiving company is made by the Service Provider\
    \ (Intercompany Team)\n\n> Please note that if the invoice is issued and posted\
    \ in the same SAP instance, the posting is done automatically.\n\n-   Automated\
    \ postings as described above are enabled for different platforms (different ERP\
    \ system instances).\n\nb)  All deliveries between Client related parties should\

    \ resulting from sundry invoicing at the month.\n\n    -   Cut-off date for sundry\
