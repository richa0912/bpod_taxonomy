- context: "### Send RTR C2.12 Wip report to the Sourcing Unit for review (MET) \n\
    \nWhen the report is received by MET, they should do a sense check and forward\
    \ it to the relevant people (usually local finance, engineering) in the Sourcing\
    \ Unit.\n\nWhen preparing the file for the SU it is advised to **highlight** the\
    \ projects where they should put more focus, or which projects will be overdue\
    \ in the next report, so they can make preventive actions on those *(if you see\
    \ some projects with end date in current month, you know that those will become\
    \ overdue soon, so it can be good to already ask for end date extension if the\
    \ SU confirms it will not be finalized before the current deadline).*\n\nThe **Sourcing\
    \ Unit** is then responsible for the **review** of the relevant projects and for\
    \ making **comments** and providing the necessary information for the possible\
    \ IO End date extensions. This information should be:\n\n-   Reason for the delay\n\
    \n-   New project end date (if end date extension is required)\n\nBy rule, the\
    \ projects with status \"**Overdue**\" should always be commented, but to comment\
    \ the projects with status \"Not overdue\" is optional (exception is region of\
    \ DACH where comments in all lines are required to capture also projects that\
    \ have to be capitalized before end date). Of course if a 'Not overdue' project\
    \ is delayed then it can be extended at any time, you don't need to wait until\
    \ it becomes 'Overdue'."
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What should MET do when they receive the RTR C2.12 WIP report?
    answer: MET should do a sense check and then forward the report to the relevant
      people (usually local finance, engineering) in the Sourcing Unit.
  - question: What is the purpose of highlighting certain projects in the WIP report
      sent to sourcing unit for review?
    answer: The purpose of highlighting certain projects in the WIP report sent to
      sourcing unit for review is to draw attention to projects that require more
      focus or that will be overdue in the next report, so that preventive actions
      can be taken.
  - question: What information should the Sourcing Unit provide when reviewing the
      WIP report?
    answer: 'When reviewing the WIP report, the Sourcing Unit should provide:
      *   Reason for the delay

      *   New project end date (if end date extension is required)'
- context: 'At the start of each month (by WD +6) IBM sends a report to all Sourcing
    Units and the relevant MET with the actual **open WIP balance** for each company
    codes (snapshot is taken at the end of the previous month from SAP).
    **RTR C2.12** **Control**- To ensure that all capital expenditure projects due
    for capitalization, are capitalized before period close, periodic reporting of
    all open capital expenditure projects is produced, showing for all projects their
    start and end date along with their percentage of completion (with respect to
    budget utilization). For all Capex projects / IOs, start and end dates are mandatory
    to be filled out at the time of creating projects / IOs. All projects / IOs that
    are 100% complete with respect to budget utilization or crossed their end date,
    are investigated and potentially capitalized.
    In this report every SU can see the current open WIP balance on **Company code**
    and **CPX** level. If there are multiple company codes for a SU, you can see multiple
    sheets in the file:
    -   **Instruction**: what is the objective of this report and what actions are
    required
    -   **UBF03/ICFE/HPC/NATMAN:** actual data for the different categories / company
    codes
    -   **AUC Details**: detailed snapshot of open AUC balance, including Internal
    Order numbers (all company codes)
    The main data can be found on the sheets named by the Categories (HPC, UBF03,
    ICFE etc.), these tabs have to be reviewed and filled with the relevant comments.
    -   **Company code:** relevant company code
    -   **CPX number:** Marlin capex ID
    -   **CPX name:** Marlin capex description
    -   **Plant**: relevant plant code
    -   **IO number:** (not available for all company codes). If IO number is not
    filled here, you can check the relevant Internal Orders for a specific CPX on
    sheet "**AUC Details"**
    -   **AUC number:** (not available for all company codes)
    -   **Start date:** IO start date, taken from SAP
    -   **End date:** IO end date, taken from SAP
    -   **Authorized budget:** current budget, taken from SAP (if budget has been
    changed after the initial submission, this column should reflect the modified
    budget)
    -   **Actual cost:** actual spend on the relevant IO
    -   **Overspend/Underspend:** =(authorized budget -- actual cost)
    -   **AUC balance:** current open AUC balance
    -   **Currency:** local currency
    -   **% budget utilized:** =(actual cost divided by authorized budget). If above
    100%, comment is required.
    -   **WIP ageing:** =(current date -- IO start date) showing how old the CPX is
    -   **Overdue ageing:** =(current date -- IO end date). Positive value if IO is
    overdue, negative if not overdue'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the purpose of the RTR C2.12 control?
    answer: The purpose of the RTR C2.12 control is to ensure that all capital expenditure
      projects due for capitalization are capitalized before period close, by producing
      periodic reports of all open capital expenditure projects.
  - question: What information is included in the open WIP balance report?
    answer: 'Following information is included in the open WIP balance report.

      *   Company code and CPX level

      *   Start and end dates of projects

      *   Percentage of completion with respect to budget utilization

      *   Actual data for different categories and company codes

      *   AUC Details, including Internal Order numbers and AUC balance'
  - question: How is % budget utilized calculated in open WIP Balance report.
    answer: In Open WIP Balance report, % budget utilization is calculated by dividing
      actual cost by authorized budget. A comment needs to be filled in if it is greater
      than 100%.
