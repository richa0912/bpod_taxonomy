    In Revaluation and Allocation, there are 7 journals.


    This DTP covers the process of preparation of one those journals "NG-A/R Revaluation
    & Allocation" from the below list However process is same for all the journals
    listed below


    Email received from Sigma in generic mailbox. These are monthly auto scheduled
    jobs from Sigma -- which will auto run and send the reports to "Email -- Finance
    SS". The preparer would need to have access to this email box to access the reports
    from Sigma.


    For Accounts payable allocation Journal (highlighted in green in above screenshot),
    process is same. However, this needs to be booked in BF library. So, whosoever
    is booking the AP allocation in BF library, they are also supposed to book offset
    entries in the SS library.so that there is no intercompany difference.


    The below email screenshot is for journal "Inventory Allocation to branches-SS
    Library"


    Likewise, different emails will be received with data required for journals with
    respective subject lines of particular journals
