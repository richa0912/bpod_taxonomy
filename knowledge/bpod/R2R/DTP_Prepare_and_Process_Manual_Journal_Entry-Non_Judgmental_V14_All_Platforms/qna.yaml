- context: "# 1 Introduction \n\n> The Effective Financial Control and Reporting (EFCR)\
    \ programme has been established within Client as a joint initiative between the\
    \ Group Controller's Department and Enterprise Support. This is one of the Continuous\
    \ Improvement initiatives that will support Client business growth through simpler,\
    \ faster and therefore more cost effective processes.\n>\n> The Effective Financial\
    \ Control & Reporting Programme is an important driver for speed & simplification\
    \ and aims to deliver:\n\n-   A truly global 'end-to-end' financial control process\
    \ with improved quality and reduced complexity and cost and\n\n-   An accelerated\
    \ financial reporting cycle - from 5 weeks to 2 weeks.\n\n> As an important step\
    \ forward to achieve these ambitious goals, the Global R2R Client Process Model\
    \ was developed representing Client best practices across all regions, platforms\
    \ and different R2R process participants. As a logical output Global Standard\
    \ Desktop Procedures were created which are documenting the processes on a detailed\
    \ level and are supporting the Client growth by:\n\n-   Simplifying and harmonising\
    \ the end to end R2R processes globally\n\n-   Exploiting technology to be faster\
    \ and more cost effective\n\n-   Incorporating a zero based control approach\n\
    \n-   Creating global, harmonised timings in order to ensure the accelerated financial\
    \ reporting cycle."
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The main goals of the programme are to deliver:

      *  A truly global ''end-to-end'' financial control process with improved quality
      and reduced complexity and cost.

      *  An accelerated financial reporting cycle - from 5 weeks to 2 weeks.'
    question: What are the main goals of the Effective Financial Control & Reporting
      Programme?
  - answer: he Global R2R Client Process Model represents **Client best practices
      across all regions, platforms, and different R2R process participants, and was
      developed as an important step forward to achieve the programme's ambitious
      goals.
    question: What is the Global R2R Client Process Model?
  - answer: 'he benefits of the Global Standard Desktop Procedures are that they:

      *  Simplify and harmonise the end-to-end R2R processes globally.

      *  Exploit technology to be faster and more cost-effective.

      *  Incorporate a zero-based control approach.

      *  Create global, harmonised timings to ensure the accelerated financial reporting
      cycle.'
    question: What are the benefits of the Global Standard Desktop Procedures?
- context: "# 2 Purpose \n\n> Journals can be classified as either Judgmental or Non\
    \ judgmental as per their ownership and approval methodology:\n\na.  **Judgmental\
    \ Journals** require business knowledge as some judgement is needed to ensure\
    \ that the amounts involved are correct. The Country or Supply Chain Company Finance\
    \ is responsible for their initiation and approval.\n\nb.  **Non Judgmental Journals**\
    \ do not require detailed business knowledge and the steps to prepare and post\
    \ the journals are explicitly explained in the respective desktop procedure. These\
    \ can then be processed over and over again without any judgement involved. Booking\
    \ is initiated on the regular basis (at the period end) by the Service Provider\
    \ based on the predefined list and rules set up by Client.These are hence under\
    \ the responsibility of 3^rd^ Party Service Provider for initiation and approval.\n\
    \n> Examples of JEs which can be classified as non-judgmental::\n\n-   Journal\
    \ is prepared and posted from entirely by 3PSP; the journal entry is part of the\
    \ Non-Judgmental Journal Entry list and the working instruction exists,\n\n- \
    \  Journal input is extracted by Country and sent to 3PSP without any modification;\
    \ based on this input 3PSP prepares and posts the journal. Journal is part of\
    \ the Non-Judgmental Journal Entry and the working instruction exists; it has\
    \ to be documented in the working instruction that inputs are not modified,\n\n\
    -   Journal values are calculated centrally, but 3PSP understands and is able\
    \ to validate their correctness; the journal entry is part of the Non-Judgmental\
    \ Journal Entry list and the working instruction exists,\n\n-   During journal\
    \ calculation or validation the Country exercises judgement/inputs but this judgment\
    \ (or input) is understood by 3PSP and 3PSP can validate its correctness. the\
    \ journal entry is part of the Non-Judgmental Journal Entry list and the working\
    \ instruction exists,\n\n-   Journals are prepared and posted based on contracts,\
    \ hence 3PSP understands and is able to validate the correctness of values; the\
    \ journal entry is part of the Non-Judgmental Journal Entry list and the working\
    \ instruction exists,\n\n-   Journals are prepared and posted based on fixed/recurring\
    \ amounts. 3PSP is not able to prepare the working instruction or 3PSP not able\
    \ to validate journal values. If values are recurring journal can be moved to\
    \ recurring entries with first entry posted by Country according to global ToA.\n\
    \n> There are following accounting areas which may result in a need for accrual\
    \ posting:\n\n-   All Record and Account entries: Fixed Assets, Capital Project,\
    \ Cost Accounting, Inventory Accounting, Sales Accounting, Treasury payments\n\
    \n-   Pre-defined or not Period Close Entries: accruals, prepayments, provisions,\
    \ foreign exchange adjustments, tax reporting\n\n-   Reconciliations: Trial Balance\
    \ Reconciliations (incl. reconciliations of Sub-Ledgers to General Ledger), Bank\
    \ Reconciliations, Third Party Reconciliations, Intercompany Reconciliations\n\
    \n-   Adjustment entries following P&L and Balance Sheet Reviews\n\n-   P&L analysis:\
    \ Fixed/Variable costs variance analysis\n\n-   Working Capital Analysis: Account\
    \ Receivables ageing Analysis, Days Payable Outstanding analysis, WIP ageing analysis.\n"
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The two types of journals based on their ownership and approval methodology
      are:

      *   Judgmental Journals: require business knowledge and judgment to ensure that
      the amounts involved are correct.

      *   Non-Judgmental Journals: do not require detailed business knowledge and
      the steps to prepare and post the journals are explicitly explained in the respective
      desktop procedure.'
    question: What are the two types of journals based on their ownership and approval
      methodology?
  - answer: 'Examples of Non-Judgmental Journals include:

      *   Journals prepared and posted entirely by the 3rd Party Service Provider.

      *   Journals input extracted by the Country and sent to the 3rd Party Service
      Provider without modification.

      *   Journals values calculated centrally, but the 3rd Party Service Provider
      understands and is able to validate their correctness.'
    question: What are some examples of Non-Judgmental Journals?
  - answer: 'Some accounting areas that may result in a need for accrual posting include:

      *   All Record and Account entries: Fixed Assets, Capital Project, Cost Accounting,
      Inventory Accounting, Sales Accounting, Treasury payments.

      *   Pre-defined or not Period Close Entries: accruals, prepayments, provisions,
      foreign exchange adjustments, tax reporting.

      *   Reconciliations: Trial Balance Reconciliations, Bank Reconciliations, Third
      Party Reconciliations, Intercompany Reconciliations.

      *  Adjustment entries following P&L and Balance Sheet Reviews.

      *  P&L analysis: Fixed/Variable costs variance analysis.

      *  Working Capital Analysis: Account Receivables ageing Analysis, Days Payable
      Outstanding analysis, WIP ageing analysis.'
