    ## Objectives of the Process

    Objective of this process is to review a Trial Balance after all the Journals
    have been posted into the ERP AX for a month. This process is of paramount importance
    because after doing the first level review it can easily be find out if any entry
    is missing due to variance between actuals and forecasted values. It is also necessary
    to know with this initial TB review, that all the entries posted are correct.
    It is vital that actual numbers are in line with budgeted and forecasted numbers
    and if it is not, either the reason for this deviation is identified and agreed
    as correct or corrective actions are required to be taken.

    With this review it is also possible to compare the numbers month over month and
    find out if there is any abnormal movement in PL or BS.

    question: In GL Client UK Trial balance Review process, what inputs are required
      to generate Trial Balance report in AX?
- context: 'The previous window will come up again, click OK to generate the report.

    So row no. 247 has exactly the same amount of 36,525.04, which means account no.
    275052 is a newly created account no. in AX.

    Copy this account code and its description and paste it into the **AX TB** tab
    just below account no. **275020,** because in the number sequence of the Chart
    of Accounts 275052 comes after 275020 in AX accounts.

    Insert a new row after account code 275020 and paste the newly created account
    code into it.

    Also drag the **left** formula from cell O236 to cell O237 and the vlookup formula
    from cell D236 to D237.

    Column A has HFM codes in the **AX TB** tab which need to be updated too for the
    new account codes.

    To get the HFM codes for newly created accounts, go to AX and open the Chart of
    Accounts Details window.

    Type **275052** in the search area in the Ledger account column and press enter
    on your keyboard.

    Copy the Master account number **LB7050** and paste it in column A in cell A237
    against account no. **275052**.

    Go back to the Download AX tab and check if the variance has disappeared for 2
    or not.

    A similar exercise needs to be done for account numbers starting with a 3. The
    amount which needs to be agreed is 381,420.28

    Row no. 286 has the same amount which means account no. 300500 is a new account.

    Copy the account no. and its description and paste it into the **AX TB** tab just
    below 300002 which is in sequence.

    Also copy the formula from Cell O273 to O274 and vlookup formula from cell D273
    to D274.

    Now get the HFM code for account no. 300500 from AX.

    Copy LB1020 and paste it in AX tab.

    Go back to the **Download AX** tab again and check the variances. Here the variances
    are gone and the sum is zero too in cell L16 and M16.

    The reason for having 2 tabs for AX TB report (**Download AX and AX TB**) is because
    the TB downloaded from AX is not in a good readable format. So the AX TB tab has
    been created which fetches the data from the Download AX tab and presents in simple
    readable format.

    [Important note : - All the rows in Column A in the **AX TB** tab must have HFM
    codes for all non zero values in column D, so that there is no variance in the
    comparison table in the **Download AX** tab.]{.ul}'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'In Trial Balance Review file, after copying the newly created account
      code and its description, you need to do the following.

      1. Paste it into the AX TB tab just below the relevant account code,

      2. Insert a new row

      3. Drag the formulas from the previous row to the new row.'
    question: What do I need to do after copying the newly created account code and
      its description in Trial Balance Review file?
  - answer: The purpose of having two tabs is to present the data from the Download
      AX tab in a simple readable format, as the original TB downloaded from AX is
      not in a good readable format.
    question: What is the purpose of having two tabs for the AX TB report (Download
      AX and AX TB)?
  - answer: We need to update the HFM codes in column A of the AX TB tab of AX TB
      report to ensure that there is no variance in the comparison table in the 'Download
      AX' tab, and to match the HFM codes with the non-zero values in column D.
    question: Why do we need to update the HFM codes in column A of the AX TB tab
      in AX TB report?
- context: 'The report will come to your CLIENT email box. Keep in mind that sometimes
    the report goes to Junk E-Mail folder too. If it goes to Junk E-Mail folder then
    it has to be moved to your Inbox first before the report can be acccessed.

    The email will look like as shown in the below screenshot. The report will come
    as a text file as attachment in the email.

    Double click on the attachment to open it.

    Select all the data(Ctrl + A) of the file and copy and paste it into the **Download
    AX** tab in Trial Balance review file.

    Once the data is pasted, the numbers on the right side in column L and M will
    update automatically as the formula''s are linked to the raw data updated .

    Column K has serial numbers from 1 to 9 and letter Z.

    Column L has numbers linked with the previously pasted data in the file. Cell
    L5 has a **sumif** formula as highlighted below which is calculating the sum of
    all the Accounts which start with a 1. Accounts numbers are in column A.

    Similarly L6 has a **sumif** formula which is calculating the sum of all the Accounts
    which starts with a 2 and so on and so forth.

    So if there are any variances in column O, this means some new accounts have been
    added in the month.

    Here there are new accounts codes starting with 2 and 3. A variance in Z means
    one or more formulas in column I are not fully dragged till the last row where
    the report ends, therefore data is missing.

    The first thing that needs to be checked is whether column I is populated till
    the last row where the reports ends. Go to the last row where the data ends and
    see if column I has any letters in it or not. Column I has a **left** formula
    in it which is picking the first digit of the account number from column A.

    **=LEFT(A5,1)**

    So if the formula is not updated down to the last row then there will always be
    a variance in column O.

    Cells I563 and I564 do not have a formula, so update them and check the variance
    in column O.

    Updating the formulae in these not only removes the variance in column L but also
    Cell L16 becomes 0. That means debits and credits are equal of the Trial Balance
    and sum to 0.

    But there are still variances in Account codes starting with 2 and 3 which means
    new account codes were added in AX.

    To check for that new account, you will see that all the account numbers starting
    with 2 with a value of 36,525.04. There can be one account or multiple accounts
    added so the variance can be in one row or a sum of multiple lines.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: In GL Client UK Trial balance Review process, the Trial Balance report
      will be sent to your 'CLIENT email box' as a text file attachment in the email.
    question: In GL Client UK Trial balance Review process, where will the Trial Balance
      report be sent, and what format will it be in?
  - answer: A variance in column O of Trial Balance Review file indicates that new
      accounts have been added in the month, and you need to check for the new account
      codes and update the formulas accordingly.
    question: What does a variance in column O of Trial Balance Review file indicate?
  - answer: To resolve the variance  in column O of Trial Balance Review file, you
      need to update the formula in column I down to the last row where the data ends,
      using the '=LEFT(A5,1)' formula, and then check the variance in column O again.
    question: How do I resolve a variance in column O of Trial Balance Review file
      due to a missing formula in column I?
