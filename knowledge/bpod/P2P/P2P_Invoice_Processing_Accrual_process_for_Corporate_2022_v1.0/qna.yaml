  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: To update missing coding, the process involves using Peoplesoft Purchase
      Order Inquiry (Main Menu > Purchasing > Purchase Orders > Review PO Information
      \> Purchase Orders) to retrieve the coding information. The business unit and
      PO ID from the Excel spreadsheet are entered to search for the purchase order,
      and the coding is retrieved from the purchase order page. The coding is then
      entered into the Excel spreadsheet, and the data is filtered and sorted to ensure
      accuracy.
    question: What is the process for updating missing coding in the Corporate Accrual
      Report, and what tools are used to perform this task?
  - answer: UTC is the only exception that is excluded because it has the same line
      of coding for every single entry, making it safe to save with the current coding.
    question: What is the significance of the UTC exception in the accrual process?
  - answer: The VLOOKUP function is used to retrieve the correct coding information
      from the April spreadsheet and populate the AV column in the May spreadsheet.
      The function is set up to look up the invoice number in column D (Invoice number)
      and retrieve the corresponding coding information. The data is then sorted and
      filtered to remove any incorrect or missing data, and the final result is a
      list of accurate invoice numbers with corresponding coding information.
    question: How is the VLOOKUP function used to populate the AV column in the May
      spreadsheet with accurate data, and what steps are taken to filter and sort
      the data?
