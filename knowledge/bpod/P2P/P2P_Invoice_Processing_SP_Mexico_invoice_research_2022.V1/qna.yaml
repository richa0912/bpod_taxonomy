- context: '# Process Detail ## Overview > To research the status of Service Parts
    Mexico invoices submitted through the Mexico Portal for Mexico suppliers and invoices
    from US suppliers through CLIENT Vendors.

    > To be researching invoices that come from Mexico suppliers shipping within Mexico
    and US suppliers shipping to Mexico. All parts shipping to Mexico PDC or dealer
    are paid out of the Mexico office. There will be no payment information in PeopleSoft
    for these invoices,should need to email the Mexico AP contact for payment information
    when needed.

    > Invoices from Mexico suppliers are required to be submitted through Mexico Portal.
    The invoice number that you will use for your research is generated by the Portal
    when the invoice is uploaded. This number is referred to as Portal ID.

    > The Portal ID is used because the Mexico Portal can electronically update payment
    information once the invoice has paid. Use of this portal ID as the invoice number
    instead of supplier invoice number,has saved the Mexico office many hours a week
    manually updating payment information.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The purpose of researching the status of Service Parts Mexico invoices
      is to verify the payment information for invoices submitted through the Mexico
      Portal for Mexico suppliers and invoices from US suppliers through CLIENT Vendors.
      This research includes invoices from Mexico suppliers shipping within Mexico
      and US suppliers shipping to Mexico.
    question: What is the purpose of researching the status of Service Parts Mexico
      invoices submitted through the Mexico Portal, and what types of invoices are
      included in this research?
  - answer: The Portal ID is a unique invoice number generated by the Mexico Portal
      when an invoice is uploaded. It is used as the invoice number for research purposes
      because it allows for electronic updates of payment information once the invoice
      has been paid. This has saved the Mexico office many hours of manual work.
    question: how is the Portal ID used in the research process
  - answer: Since these invoices are paid out of the Mexico office, there will be
      no payment information in PeopleSoft for these invoices. Therefore, when researching
      these invoices, it may be necessary to email the Mexico AP contact for payment
      information when needed.
    question: What is the significance of not having payment information in PeopleSoft
      for invoices from Mexico suppliers shipping within Mexico and US suppliers shipping
      to Mexico?
