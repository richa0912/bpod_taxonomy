    +-------------------------------+

    On daily basis, IBM VMD team should login to CAVI to check if there are any requests
    pending action.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: After Approver has decided that supplier creation is needed, the onboarding
      registration starts.
    question: What is the next step after the client approver accepts the creation
      request?
  - answer: The verification is an automated process performed by the CAVI tool or
      by IBM VMD Team.
    question: How is the data provided by Vendor is verified?
  - answer: IBM VMD Team checks on regular basis if the supplier already exists to
      avoid duplicate entry.
    question: Once the vendor creation request is received, what does IBM VMD Team
      do with the ticket?
- context: '1.  **Check against the DPL and embargoed countries list**

    As per internal policies, IBM VMD team is not allowed to process any requests
    that might come from suppliers included in the Denied Party List or are subject
    of US embargo and sanctions program.

    The list of embargoed/sanctioned countries are **Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria,
    Russia, Afghanistan and the Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia (Zaporizhzhia)**
    regions of **Ukraine.**

    The full list of US embargo and sanctions programs is available in the IBM w3
    environment.

    You should check if the vendor is not located in any of mentioned countries/regions.
    If yes, please move to step [5.2.14 Provide comment and reject request](#provide-comment-and-reject-request-1)

    If vendor is not located in one of the embargoed/sanctioned countries, please
    perform the check against DPL database.

    DPL is a webpage available in the IBM w3 environment and contains a list of parties
    that IBM is not allowed to conduct business with, updated on regular basis.

    You should login to the page (if prompted) with your w3 credentials (IBM email
    and related password).

    Next, provide vendor name or address and press "Submit" to confirm.

    The results are presented below:

    If there''s a match (vendor name or address matches the search result) please
    move to step [5.2.14 Provide comment and reject request](#provide-comment-and-reject-request-1)

    If there is no exact search result it means the vendor is not in the DPL and request
    can be processed further in CAVI.

    Please also download the screening result as PDF, by clicking the "PDF" button
    and save it to your PC. After vendor is created in SAP, it should be attached
    in XK03 as a proof for the check done.

    This is how the generated file should look like:

    To attach the document in SAP, please go to transaction XK03:

    Select vendor number, company code in which the vendor has been created and purchase
    organization (always CZPO), select all fields and confirm with enter:

    Address data will be displayed:

    Next, please select the "Services for object" button:

    A pop-up will appear -- click on "Create":

    Choose "Create Attachment":

    Select the file destination and the file itself and confirm with "Open":

    After upload, a confirmation will be shown:

    2.  **Check the vendor in ARES/VIES database.**

    The next step is to validate the vendor against government website to confirm
    the data provided by vendor/requestor.

    In case of any mismatches during any of the validations, please move to step [5.2.14
    Provide comment and reject request](#provide-comment-and-reject-request-1).'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The list of embargoed/sanctioned countries are Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
      Syria, Russia, Afghanistan and the Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia
      (Zaporizhzhia) regions of Ukraine.
    question: Which countries belong under embargoed/sanctioned list?
  - answer: ARES database applies to vendors located in Czech Republic and VIES for
      vendors located in the European Union. For vendors outside the EU, there is
      no specific database, and we have to rely on the documents attached by vendor/requestor.
    question: To which Vendors do ARES & VIES database apply?
  - answer: DPL is a webpage available in the IBM w3 environment and contains a list
      of parties that IBM is not allowed to conduct business with, updated on regular
      basis.
    question: What is DPL?

    **Note:** It may happen that the notification sent by CAVI can be tricked by vendor''s
    email client as span or even blocked, so to be sure that the action on vendors
    side is taken properly after our action in CAVI is completed, you can inform supplier
    via email (as reply to the email received).

    +------------------------------------------------------+

    In case a vendor was found in DPL and/or embargo and sanctions list, please send
    following notification to the requester and close (delete) the request in CAVI:

    **"Dear Requestor, thank you for your email/ Unfortunately, your request cannot
    be processed by IBM VMD team because the supplier country is on IBM embargo list.
    Sorry for the inconvenience caused."**

    In case of any other mismatches/discrepancies found during the validation, that
    require action on requestor and/or vendor side, please describe the issue in the
    "Notes" option and then reject the request.

    Use option "**Private**" to notify **requestor only** and option "**Public**"
    to notify **requestor and supplier.**

    Use option "**Request More Information -- Yes**" to generate an **email notification**
    in addition to note sent in CAVI.

    **Please always set Note Type as Public and Request More Information as Yes to
    ensure that an email will be generated as well.**

    **Note:** In case of requests created via Proxy, notifications and emails will
    only be sent to requestor.

    Below you can find an example of how the email generated by CAVI looks like:

    Once notification has been sent, please reject the request in CAVI:

    Provide proper rejection reason and confirm with "Submit":

- context: 'To login to CAVI, please follow the below steps.

    First, login to Client environment, please connect the GlobalProcect VPN.

    **Note:** If you are connected to Cisco Any Connect (IBM VPN) you need to disconnect
    first.

    Open a web browser and go to following address:

    You will be prompted to login using your Client credentials. You can choose previously
    used account or if you are logging in for the first time, you need to provide
    your Client email address.

    Then, you will be prompted to provide password. There is no separate password
    creation for CAVI, so you should use the same credentials as for logging to other
    Client environment, like Citrix for example.

    Then, you will be automatically moved to the two-factor authentication. Please
    follow the method that was established during Client account setup. In this example,
    it''s Microsoft Authenticator application.

    Once login is successful, following screen appears:

    Please choose the role "BSO DM Associate" and confirm with "Continue"

    Then, please select the "Ready to approve" queue in CAVI:

    If there are any open requests pending actions, you will see a list at the bottom
    of the screen:

    Records pending action on IBM VMD teams side should always have status "GES DM
    Review", like on the screenshot above.

    To open a particular line please click on "X" icon

    A list of checks done automatically by CAVI tool will pop up:

    If there''s any point that is not marked with green tick, you should pay special
    attention to this area.

    Independently of the indicators, the first action to take is to check if the supplier
    does already exist in SAP.

    To do that, please login to SAP as described below.
