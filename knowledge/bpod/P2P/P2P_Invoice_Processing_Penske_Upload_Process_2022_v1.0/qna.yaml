    Collections) with a link to the Client file.


    2.  Click on the link provided in the email and open


    3.  When you click on the link it directs you to the spreadsheet of the folder


    4.  Type ''GN1'' in CS box, it has all those additional lines


    5.  Column GK consists of the number of records and column GL has its additional
    lines


    > **Note**: if any data is missing in the excel or incorrect, we would reply to
    the email and ask for the correct data and information.


    6.  Change column" M" to the User ID of the person who is uploading the file.
    If the User ID is not the sender''s Or the person who is uploading the file, change
    the user ID (If Sharon Clark sends the file and Terri Johnson uploads the file,
    but the user ID is neither of those users, correct the user ID to the uploader''s
    user ID)


    7.  Follow the path **M:\> AP voucher upload\> CE Win10** to open the **ExcelUploadForvoucher_Client.Xlsm**
    file to upload the data


    8.  Highlight the row 4 & paste the copied data using the special value option.


    > Note: If pasting special value is not an option, then return to the original
    file and copy again. If paste special value is not used, then the file will not
    upload to PeopleSoft


    9.  If there is an error with the upload, the box will say an error has occurred.
    Review by running the PeopleSoft Staging process to ensure the file was not uploaded.


    If the file does not exist in staging table, then you will need to start the entire
    process again. If the error continues, then you may have bad data in the file.


    In the original file, delete any blank rows at the bottom or blank columns to
    the far right. If that still does not resolve the issue on the next attempt, then
    contact local System Support to assist.'

    question: What to do if there is an error with the upload in peoplesoft?
- context: '10. Open PeopleSoft to verify upload was successful.


    11. Select Reporting Tools


    12. Select Query Viewer


    13. Search for Staged Vouchers query: ZI_AP_STAGED_VOUCHERS


    14. Select Run to Excel


    15. Enter KUP in the Origin box and select view results.


    16. Select Open, then Enable Editing.


    17. Verify invoices are in the Staging table. Scroll through the file to see if
    it matches the original file. In this case, the upload was successful.


    If the query did not return any records, then continue to run the query periodically
    over the next hour. If the records still are not showing, then an email must be
    sent to the. DL PeopleSoft FSCM Support Team to review. Copy IT Service Desk as
    well for tracking issues. Please see an example of an email.


    In some cases, a job has timed out ahead of the upload and once that is cleared,
    the upload will feed into PeopleSoft. There are other times when the file must
    be uploaded again. Proceed with caution in those instances, as there have been
    times when the file has been duplicated when we have been instructed to upload
    again. If the file is duplicated, then follow the Desk Procedures for Pre-Edit
    and Recycle to clear. If it is a large volume, then refer the File Maintenance
    Desk Procedures for Mass Deletion.


    If the support team says the file has been uploaded, but it does not show in Staged
    Vouchers, then enough time may have passed where the voucher has been created
    and can be found in Regular Entry by searching by Business Unit and Invoice Number.
    If the upload runs close to 4:30 EST, then you may ''miss'' the vouchers in staging
    tables and they will be able to be viewed in Regular Entry since the voucher has
    already been created.'
