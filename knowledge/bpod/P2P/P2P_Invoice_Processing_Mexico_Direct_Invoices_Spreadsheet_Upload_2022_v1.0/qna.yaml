      and/or revision). This is not the final upload to PeopleSoft.

      Frequency: Daily.

      System: Client Portal, MS Excel.'
    question: In which system spreadsheet upload takes place?
  - answer: "The Reports must be Uploaded before 2: 15 PM.\nFollowing are the Locations\
      \ from which Reports are Pulled.\n'\tLinea 1 Productivo - 01100.\n'\tLinea 2\
      \ Productivo - 06500."
    question: What is the deadline for reports upload?
  - answer: Formatting and Creating Spreadsheet to Upload in the Client Invoice Database.
    question: What is the responsibility of Invoice Processing Team?
- context: "Duplicate Values: the app will show you what values are duplicate; you\
    \ must remove them from the upload file (the one saved in the M drive). Or the\
    \ invoice was already uploaded once to the database (database will show date and\
    \ time when invoice was upload; it will also show you who uploaded the invoice).\
    \ Invoice then must be manually keyed.  \n\n    Formatting Cells: if there is\
    \ a value that is not formatted as required, the app will not complete the upload.\
    \ Check that all your values match the same criteria within the column. For example:\
    \ There are some vendors that have a different vendor code in the portal. We use\
    \ the vendor code that People Soft shows. When the analyst changes the vendor\
    \ code on the report, Excel automatically converts the data to a general formatting:\
    \ \n\n    We need to have the data as values. We need to add the apostrophe to\
    \ convert the data to values: \n\n    Once you correct the errors, the upload\
    \ should go through successfully.  \n\n    Once the upload is completed, the app\
    \ will automatically send an email with Kickouts. Kickouts are invoices that could\
    \ not be uploaded due to pricing issues, PO issues, wrong receipt or wrong vendor\
    \ code, and BAAN vs PeopleSoft lines that did not match. This file is worked by\
    \ Data Entry to manually process those invoices. \n\n Problem \n\nUser gets the\
    \ following Warning. \n\nDiscussion \n\nThe previous set of records was not fully\
    \ processed. Permanent records were created, but not marked that they had been\
    \ uploaded. The easiest solution is to remove the not-uploaded records and let\
    \ the user reprocess the original spreadsheet. \n\nSolution \n\n    Open the application.\
    \ \n\n    Open the tbl_pp_MexInvoices table, sort by created date, and look for\
    \ records without an upload date.\n\n    Remove all records without an upload\
    \ date."
