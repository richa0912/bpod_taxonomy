  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What are the control risks associated with Control Point - Registered
      data and invoice data must be matched?
    answer: ' The control risk associated is the late submitting of invoices due to
      lack of document, incorrect information, or wrong GL account.'
  - question: ' Where does the invoice come from in the GSSC Portal process?'
    answer: The invoice comes from the scanning center, where the vendor sends the
      invoice and supporting documents to CROWN ~ CAD Networks and Iron Mountain where
      Client PIC sends scanned invoice/debit note into the email address
  - question: "What is the final output of the process Invoice Processing \u2013 General\
      \ Expenses?"
    answer: The invoice is posted in SAP and is ready for payment, and is sent to
      the subsidiary.

  - question: What is the scenario with BQMS contract when posting an SR on settlement
      request?
    answer: When posting SR on settlement request using NERP, certain GL account requires
      IBM PIC to input BQMS contract number in which to be provided by the Sub PIC.
      IBM PIC need to input this contract number on settlement request when processing.
- context: 'IBM BPO AP team has to perform the following checks before processing
    an Invoice for General Expenses:


    -   IBM BPO AP team verifies the documents received for its completeness and correctness.

    -   Upon receipt of invoices IBM BPO AP team to contact requestor/HR-General Affairs/GWP
    or Customer Service team for additional supporting documents such as Knox approval
    etc. in case anything is missing.

    -   If the invoice is invalid (content wrongly issued or not following the basic
    rules of issuing Invoices and Receipts under Accounting Law), the invoice has
    to be rejected and sent back to the Vendor (if vendor sent the document package
    into scanning center) or rejected to PIC (if PIC kept the hardcopy and sent the
    scanned files to Iron Mountain email address).

    -   The AP Invoice Processor should ensure that invoice is not duplicate, prior
    to processing. (Incase the invoice already posted by SUB PIC prior to the time
    receiving the SR by IBM, SUB PIC need to inform IBM PIC once receiving email requested
    to provide supporting docs, avoiding the case that SUB PIC posts in different
    invoice number, then IBM cannot detect duplication.)'
  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What action does the IBM BPO AP team take if additional supporting documents
      are required for an invoice for General Expenses?
    answer: The IBM BPO AP team contacts the requestor/HR-General Affairs/GWP or Customer
      Service team to obtain the additional supporting documents.
  - question: What happens if an invoice for General Expenses is found to be invalid?
    answer: If the invoice is invalid (content wrongly issued or not following the
      basic rules of issuing Invoices and Receipts under Accounting Law), the invoice
      is rejected and sent back to the Vendor (if vendor sent the document package
      into scanning center) or rejected to PIC (if PIC kept the hardcopy and sent
      the scanned files to Iron Mountain email address).
  - question: Who should ensure that an invoice for General expenses is not duplicate
      prior to processing?
    answer: The AP Invoice Processor should ensure that invoice is not duplicate,
      prior to processing.

    a)  If the invoice was scanned too blurrily to view, IBM PIC must click on button
    "rescan" and request scanning center to scan the document package again. IBM PIC
    need follow up closedly due to TAT still running, it will causes TAT overrun if
    rescan long time didn''t come back.

    before clicking on button "reject", note down the rejection reason and send out
    an email to Client PIC, carbon copy teamleader to notify the SR has been rejected.


    c)  For reject cases, IBM PIC also must send email to CROWN \~ CAD Networks to
    request sending back the hard-copy to vendor if there is hard-copy sent through
    CROWN\~CAD Networks.

  questions_and_answers:
  - question: What is the procedure for rejecting an invoice that was issued incorrectly?
    answer: If the invoice was issued incorrectly, IBM PICs need make sure that SUBs
