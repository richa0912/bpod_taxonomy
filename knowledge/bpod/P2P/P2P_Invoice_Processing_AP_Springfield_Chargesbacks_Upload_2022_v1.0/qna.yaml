    # Process Detail

    ## Overview

    > The activity shows the uploading of chargeback invoices that has been sent by
    the Knoxville uploads mailbox from the respective plant that spreadsheet must
    be verified and stored in the M drive and uploaded to PeopleSoft via the spreadsheet
    upload process for example the goods or services are not provided and there was
    some missing documentation.

    > This missing documentation, dollar amount must be researched so the location
    is charging a dollar amount as a fee. If there was a short of dollar amt we would
    do a negative Dollar amount. And the one which has "R" with the invoice number
    are the ones that the supplier had disputed and provided supporting documentation
    to CS and have recognized as correct.

    ## Process Description:

    Chargeback files for invoices are sent as needed to Knoxville Uploads dollars
    from plant representative. The excel is uploaded to PeopleSoft via the Spreadsheet
    Upload Process.

    1.  Go to **Outlook** and click on the **Email** (**Knoxville** **upload** receive
    the email from Springfield associate and they are requesting us to upload the
    file)

    2.  This is an email that we get and It''s charging the suppliers (The **shortage**
    or **discrepancies** are the ones that are listed on the spreadsheet).

    3.  In these spreadsheets, the amounts would mostly be for **Negative** **value**.

    4.  We would see almost all items for the -\$500 charge, the -\$500 charge is
    done when the location had to do any additional work. The Positive \$500 charge
    is the reversal. Where the vendor would have disputed it, these would be with
    "R" on the invoice number. The supplier had disputed and provided supporting documentation
    to CS and the CS have recognized that this is correct, the supplier has provided
    goods and services and that''s when a reversal is processed.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: If there is missing documentation for a chargeback invoice, the dollar
      amount must be researched to determine the correct amount to charge as a fee.
      If there is a shortage of dollar amount, a negative dollar amount is done.
    question: What happens if there is missing documentation for a chargeback invoice?
  - answer: The "R" notation in the invoice number indicates that the supplier had
      disputed the charge and has provided supporting documentation to CS, which has
      been recognized as correct.
    question: What does the "R" notation in the invoice number indicate?
  - answer: The -$500 charge is done when the location had to do any additional work,
      and the positive $500 charge is the reversal of a disputed charge. The supplier
      had disputed it, but provided supporting documentation to CS, which has been
      recognized as correct.
    question: What is the significance of the -$500 charge in the spreadsheet?
- context: ' 5.  If there is a leading Zero In the supplier code or a vendor code
    on the left of the zero there will be a **green** **color** tick mark that is
    populated for That zero to Come over

    6.  We Verify the dollar amount would be the same in "**R, DF and GU**" as in
    most of the uploads

    7.  Confirm the quantity that the total **number** **of** **invoices** his it''s
    **38**

    Note: Sales tax and state tax in that scenario we have to compare their file which
    they have sent to us

    8.  Select the data right-click and **copy** the data. (Please do the selection
    GN1 cell to get all the data)

    9.  Go to **file** **explorer.**

    10. Go to "**M drive**, click on **AP voucher upload**

    11. Go to **CE** and **win** **10**

    12. If any destination file is there that needs to be **renamed**, right-click
    and renamed it

    13. **Renamed** the file to the last upload that was performed. (The previous
    uploader has forgot to name the file)

    14. Click on **Exceluploadvoucher_invupload**.

    15. A spreadsheet will open (this is a **common** **template**) then select a
    row and **paste special the values.**

    > Once pasted, confirm invoice quantity, and compare totals for columns R, DF,
    and GU (highlight each column individually) to ensure they match the amount from
    the original spreadsheet. If the amounts do not match respond to the original
    email advising there is a discrepancy between amounts.

    16. See dollar amount matches in **R, DF, and GU** (here the amounts are the same)

    17. This template is used to, if anything is to break out, they would look into
    the template here and design it to what you need, in a specific color. There are
    specific columns for every upload but in some of the uploads, there is a specific
    column. (This is the template in the same spreadsheet)

    18. Between "**I and L"** little informatics are hidden and they are found in
    the **PeopleSoft.**

    19. Click on **Generate** **XML** and **Post.**

    20. Then a dialogue box appears to enter the User **Id and password** and click
    on **enter**

    21. Click on **Mdrive**

    22. Click on **AP voucher upload**

    23. Click on **CE Win 10**

    24. Enter the file name and click on the **Save button** (this will put the record
    in the PeopleSoft in the staging table)

    > **NOTE:** If a DEST.XML already exists, then it **must** be moved to **M:\\APVoucherUpload\\Archive**
    before creating a new one. Change the DEST.XML file name to the Upload that was
    previously done, MMDD, YYYY, and saves.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The purpose of verifying the dollar amount in columns R, DF, and GU is
      to ensure that the amounts match the amount from the original spreadsheet. If
      the amounts do not match, a response should be sent to the original email advising
      of the discrepancy.
    question: What is the purpose of verifying the dollar amount in columns R, DF,
      and GU?
  - answer: If a DEST.XML file already exists, it must be moved to the M:\APVoucherUpload\Archive
      directory before creating a new one. The DEST.XML file name should be changed
      to reflect the previous upload date in the format MMDD, YYYY.
    question: What happens if a DEST.XML file already exists in the M:\APVoucherUpload
      directory?
  - answer: If there is a leading zero in the supplier code or vendor code, a green
      color tick mark will be populated to indicate that the zero should be removed.
    question: What should be done if there is a leading zero in the supplier code
      or vendor code?

    question: Who is responsible for uploading chargeback debit invoices into PeopleSoft
- context: '**NOTE:** If there is an error with the upload, the box will say an error
    has occurred. Start the entire process again. If the error continues, then you
    may have bad data in the file. In the original file, delete any blank rows at
    the bottom or blank columns to the far right. If that still does not resolve the
    issue on the next attempt, then contact local System Support to assist. 25. Then
    a pop-up will come "**The** **process** **successfully finished**". Note: if any
    errors are found it will go to the staging table and it will go to the integration
    broker. 26. Open PeopleSoft to verify upload was successful. 27. Select **reporting**
    **tool.** 28. Click on **query** **viewer** 29. Search for **Staged Vouchers query:
    ZI_AP_STAGED_VOUCHERS**, select Run to **Excel**. 30. Enter **Origin** **KUP**
    (Knoxville Upload), Select View **Results.** 31. Select **open**. 32. Data will
    be **downloaded** then click on **enable** **editing** 33. Delete Line 1 -Voucher

    matches the original file. In this, case there have been other files uploaded.
    Remove any invoices that do not pertain to this upload by highlighting and deleting
    it. Once this is done the remaining invoices should match the original file. 35.
    These are the records that we will find that were uploaded 77 (in this case it
    has been entered **twice** as there was another uploader who did the same request,
    hence we need to send an email to terms maintenance team to mass delete of these
    duplicate records) 36. Here the amount is **doubled** (because it has been uploaded
    twice) (this needs to be sent in an email saying this has been uploaded twice)
    However, if the query did not return any records, then continue to run the query
    periodically over the next hour. If the records still are not showing, report
    an issue by going to [https://xxx.Client.com/Client](https://xxx.navistar.com/navistar)'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: If an error occurs, a message will appear indicating that an error has
      occurred, and the entire process should be started again. If the error persists,
      it may be due to bad data in the file, and the original file should be checked
      for blank rows or columns, and if necessary, local System Support should be
      contacted for assistance.
    question: What happens if an error occurs during the upload process?
  - answer: The purpose of running the Staged Vouchers query is to verify that the
      upload was successful and to check for any errors or discrepancies in the data.
      The query is used to search for staged vouchers and to view the results in Excel.
    question: What is the purpose of running the Staged Vouchers query in PeopleSoft?
  - answer: If duplicate records are found, an email should be sent to the Terms Maintenance
      team to request a mass deletion of the duplicate records. Additionally, an email
      should be sent to the team to notify them of the issue and to ask them to investigate
      further.
    question: What should be done if duplicate records are found in the Staged Vouchers
      query?
- context: However, if the query did not return any records, then continue to run
    the query periodically over the next hour. If the records still are not showing,
    report an issue by going to [https://xxx.com/Client](https://xxx.navistar.com/navistar)
    37. Open **Report** an **Issue** 38. Enter reason as PeopleSoft Integration Broker
    -- Production Critical, enter Description of an issue as Please assigns to DL
    PeopleSoft FSCM Support Team. "Please advise if there is an upload that has timed
    out or if there is an error causing the upload not to show in staging tables",
    you can add the PS Upload template where you generated the file from as an attachment
    to the incident report by saving the file to your OneDrive then selecting add
    an attachment. In some cases, a job has timed out ahead of the upload and once
    that is cleared, the upload will feed into PeopleSoft. There are other times when
    the file has to be uploaded again. Proceed with caution in those instances, as
    there have been times when the file has duplicated when we have been instructed
    to upload again. If the file is duplicated, then follow the Desk Procedures for
    Pre-Edit and Recycle to clear. If it is a large volume, then reference the File
    Maintenance Desk Procedures for Mass Deletion. If the support team says the file
    has been uploaded, but it does not show in Staged Vouchers, then enough time may
    have passed where the voucher has been created and can be found in Regular Entry
    by searching by Business Unit and Invoice Number. If the upload runs close to
    4:30 EST, then you may 'miss' the vouchers in staging tables and they will be
    able to be viewed in Regular Entry since the voucher has already been created.
    39. Once the uploading is completed then send the mail in outlook 40. Return to
    **Outlook** **Knoxville** **Uploads** and select the email for the file uploaded,

      over the next hour. If the records still do not show, an issue should be reported
      by going to https://xxx.Client.com/Client and filling out a report.
    question: What should be done if the Staged Vouchers query does not return any
      records?
  - answer: The purpose of reporting an issue to the PeopleSoft FSCM Support Team
      is to request assistance with resolving the issue with the upload not showing
      in the staging tables. The report should include a description of the issue
      and the PS Upload template as an attachment.
    question: What is the purpose of reporting an issue to the PeopleSoft FSCM Support
      Team?
  - answer: If the support team confirms that the file has been uploaded, but it does
      not show in Staged Vouchers, it may be due to the voucher having been created
      and moved to Regular Entry. In this case, the vouchers can be searched for in
      Regular Entry by business unit and invoice number.
    question: What should be done if the support team confirms that the file has been
      uploaded, but it does not show in Staged Vouchers?
