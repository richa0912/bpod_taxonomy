      in March when a list of oustanding checks that are potentially due for escheatment

      '
    question: Who receives the list of checks that need to be escheated?
- context: 'Step 10: Click on the invoice document. Click on the ''Go to'' menu item
    and then ''POP Invoice Images'' to see the documents stored for that invoice.


    Step 11: In this case, there are no documents.


    Generally, payments for garnishments have no documents. Garnishments can be confirmed
    by looking into the Header Data in the document screen and have a reference in
    the WKXXXX-XXXX format.


    NOTE: All other types of payment have accompanying documents. Use the LoadMaster
    to view these accompanying documents (refer Step 5.2.2) .


    Step 12: Pull up the vendor info from the Display Document screen below.


    Step 13: Use the vendor number, name and company code to pull up the Vendor Line
    Item Display screen (SAP transaction code FBL1N ) to find if there is a duplicate
    payment or if the vendor has been paid by any other method.


    Step 14: If no other payment has been made, a letter for outstanding check must
    be sent to the vendor. A copy of the format is in the I:\\POP\\Abandoned Property
    directory


    Step 15: In order to complete the details required by the letter and also the
    spreadsheet, use the SAP Transaction code XK03 to Display Vendor screen. Enter
    the vendor number and Company Code. Also check the Address and Control option
    box in the General date section and press the Enter key.


    Step 16: Vendor address and other information is now displayed. Use this information
    to complete the letter for the outstanding check and also the spreadsheet that
    needs to be sent to the Accounting & Finance Team.

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Generally, payments for garnishments do not have accompanying documents
      and can be confirmed by looking into the Header Data in the document screen
      and having a reference in the WKXXXX-XXXX format.
    question: What is the usual scenario for payments for garnishments?
  - answer: ' The SAP transaction code used to Display Vendor screen is XK03.'
    question: What is the SAP transaction code used to Display Vendor screen?
  - answer: Use the vendor number, name and company code to pull up the Vendor Line
      Item Display screen (SAP transaction code FBL1N ) to find if there is a duplicate
      payment or if the vendor has been paid by any other method.
    question: How to find if there is a duplicate payment or if the vendor has been
      paid by any other method?
- context: 'Step 17: Click on the ''Next Screen'' icon on the Display Vendor screen
    to find the Tax ID.


    Please note that the Tax ID in this example is 3000 which is the default for vendors
    without a Tax ID.


    Step 18: Enter the Tax ID into the spreadsheet. Enter N/A for vendors that do
    not have a Tax ID.


    Step 19: Also fill the Company Code and Cost/Profit Center details from the above
    screens.


    Step 20: Fill in the Check details in this letter from the screenshot in the Word
    document


    (refer Step 6).


    Step 21: Once the vendors reply back to the letter, the rest of the spreadsheet
    may be filled. ''Submitted to POP'' (column AA) is filled with the date when the
    vendor replies.


    The ''Unclaimed cash'' (column AE) is set to ''Yes'' and we do not reissue the
    check if it is going to go to the State and ''No'' if the check is going to be
    voided.


    For vendors who do not reply to the letter, the ''Check Voided'' (column AF) is
    filled with the date the check was voided.


    Once the ''Unclaimed Cash'' column is filled for all the lines, the list must
    be sent back to the Accounting & Finance Team.


    NOTE: We do not reissue checks for Duplicate invoices, Utility invoice payments
    (always paid on time by other methods) and Petty cash payments. These payments
    are just voided, and reclassed to the original G/L Account & Cost center Code.


    The POP team researches and processes only cash refunds for the AR Team. You can
    distinguish the AR refunds by looking at the Vendor number or Customer number
    in the document. AR refunds usually have a 7 digit customer number that begins
    with a ''3''.


    AR refunds are usually handed over to the AR Team to reasearch. After the research
    is completed, the AR Team will communicate to the POP Team if the checks need
    to be voided, reissued or escheated to the State.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: If a vendor does not have a Tax ID, N/A should be entered into the spreadsheet.
    question: What should be done if a vendor does not have a Tax ID?
  - answer: 'Once the vendors reply back to the letter, the rest of the spreadsheet
      may be filled as following:

      1. ''Submitted to POP'' (column AA) is filled with the date when the vendor
      replies.

      2. The ''Unclaimed cash'' (column AE) is set to ''Yes'' and we do not reissue
      the check if it is going to go to the State and ''No'' if the check is going
      to be voided.

      3. For vendors who do not reply to the letter, the ''Check Voided'' (column
      AF) is filled with the date the check was voided.


      Once the ''Unclaimed Cash'' column is filled for all the lines, the list must
      be sent back to the Accounting & Finance Team.'
    question: What details should be filled in spreadsheet once the vendors reply
      back to the letter?
  - answer: Checks for duplicate invoices, utility invoice payments, and petty cash
      payments are not reissued. Instead, they are voided and reclassed to the original
      G/L Account & Cost center Code.
    question: What is the policy regarding reissuing checks for duplicate invoices,
      utility invoice payments, and petty cash payments?
- context: 'Step 1: Open the file sent by the Accounting & Finance Team.


    Step 2: Hide columns A, B, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, V, W, X and Y, as these are not
    relevant to our research, to obtain the format as below:


    Step 3: Login to SAP

    screen.


    Step 5: In the Display Check Information screen, key in the Company Code as 7000,
    House Bank as ''First'' and the Account ID as ''Check''. This information is the

    Accounting and Finance Dept. The Bank Key and Bank Account fields may be left
    blank.


    Step 6: Click on the Check Issuer button to confirm that it is actually a paper
    check. ''C'' denotes check as a payment method


    Step 7: Take a screenshot of the above SAP screen and paste it into a word document.
    Click on the ''Accompanying docs'' button to check all the invoices that were
    paid against the vendor.


    Step 8: Take another screenshot of the Check Line items screen and paste it into
    the same word document.


    Step 9: You should now have a word document with all the necessary information
    to update the spreadsheet.
