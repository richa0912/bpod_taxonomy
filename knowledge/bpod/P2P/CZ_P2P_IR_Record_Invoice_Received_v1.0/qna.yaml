    If any of the data was not captured by the OCR or was recognized incorrectly,
    please perform proper corrections, as described below:

    **Recipient number (*Kod Spolecnosti*)** -- this is the address of CLIENT company,
    for which the invoice was issued. Please check if the address on the invoice is
    valid and compare it to the data captured by OCR tool. In case of mismatch, please
    check if correct address is visible in the dropdown list. If not, please compare
    the company name and address data with the attached file **"Cheat-sheet"** to
    determine the proper company code. If there''s a mismatch between company name
    and address (example: name for Client Czech and address for Client Sand or similar)
    -- always choose company code based on legal name of the entity. If you are not
    able to find the proper recipient number, please put "1" in total value field
    and delete tax amount to forward this invoice for manual verification.

    **Sender number (*Cislo dodavatele*)** -- the data in this field should exactly
    match the invoice image. In case of mismatch, please check the dropdown list if
    there is a correct sender available. If yes, please select the correct sender
    from the dropdown list.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The IBM AP Invoice Processing Team is responsible for ensuring all invoices
      received from suppliers are completely validated.
    question: Who is responsible for ensuring all invoices received from suppliers
      are completely validated?
  - answer: The Recipient number (Kod Spolecnosti) field is the address of the CLIENT
      company for which the invoice was issued. If the address on the invoice is valid,
      it should match the data captured by the OCR tool. If there is a mismatch, the
      correct address should be determined using the attached "Cheat-sheet" file.
      If the correct recipient number cannot be found, "1" should be put in the total
      value field and the tax amount should be deleted to forward the invoice for
      manual verification.
    question: What is Recipient number (Kod Spolecnosti) field in an invoice?
  - answer: If the data in the Sender number (*Cislo dodavatele*) field does not match
      the invoice image, the dropdown list should be checked for the correct sender.
      If available, the correct sender should be selected from the dropdown list.
    question: What should be done if the data in the Sender number field does not
      match the invoice image?
- context: '**VAT Rate (*Sazba DPH*)** -- based on the tax code or percentage on the
    invoice.

    **Note:** If there are multiple VAT rates mentioned on the invoice, please remove
    the value from VAT rate field. This will block the invoice from being processed
    automatically and allow the accountants to process it manually.

    If you are unsure which tax code to use, please remove the total amount as well
    and put "1" instead to move the invoice for manual processing.

    **Currency (*Mena*) --** it should always be clearly mentioned on the invoice:

    **Note:** If the invoice is issued by vendor from Czech Republic, but currency
    is different than Czech Crowns (CZK), except just putting 1 in the amount, you
    should also put a tax details (tax code, tax rate) but without putting the tax
    amount in -- see screenshot below:

    **Tax code --** each VAT rate has its respective tax code. To determine the correct
    tax code, please refer to attached file **"Cheat-sheet".**

    **Note:** If the tax amount is zero but there is no text provided on the invoice
    as mentioned in the Tax Decision Tree (*dan'' uvede zakaznik* or *neni platce
    dane*). And the vendor is from Czech Republic, you can put a zero in tax amount
    and in percentage amount and in Tax code put N0 -- see screenshot below:

    **Note:** for non-PO invoices, the there is only the VAT Rate field, tax code
    does not exist:

    **Purchase order number (*Cislo objednavky*) (for PO invoices only)** -- it should
    be read automatically; if it was not read and it''s not to be easily found on
    the invoice, this field can be left blank.

    PO numbers may have various formats. We can use PO numbers starting with **450...,
    451..., 55..., 1000...**

    We **cannot** use PO numbers starting with **51..., 460..., 458..., 2000...**

    In case you see a PO starting with above mentioned numbers, please follow the
    same logic as for any other errors or missing data to ensure the invoice will
    be forwarded for manual check.

    Next, you should check the PO number in SAP.

    **Exception:** You don''t have to do this for PO number starting with 1000....'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The VAT Rate field is based on the tax code or percentage on the invoice.
      If there are multiple VAT rates mentioned on the invoice, the value should be
      removed from this field to block the invoice from being processed automatically
      and allow the accountants to process it manually.
    question: What is the significance of the VAT Rate field in the invoice processing?
  - answer: If the tax amount is zero but there is no text provided on the invoice
      as mentioned in the Tax Decision Tree and the vendor is from Czech Republic,
      a zero can be put in tax amount and in percentage amount and Tax code should
      be N0.
    question: What should be done if the tax amount is zero and there is no text provided
      on the invoice?
  - answer: PO numbers starting with 450..., 451..., 55... and 1000... are the acceptable
      PO formats.
    question: What are acceptable PO formats in the Record Invoice Received process?

    For instance, there should be always one invoice scanned in one PDF. If during
    validation in the displayed original you found that two or more invoices are scanned
    in one PDF file, please proceed as follows:

    Login to SAP (procedure described in step [5.2.17 Complete data and trigger workflow](#complete-data-and-trigger-workflow)).
    Go to transaction "/OTX/PF03_WP -- Business Center Workplace", select the desired
    file by registration number and save the displayed document with multiple invoices
    as a PDF to your PC.

    Sends this document by email to **\"xxx\@Client.com\"** with the note to "unlink
    and rescan".

    Returns to validation tool and deletes the displayed document with multiple invoices
    from the system. (See step [5.2.16 Reject the document from the system)](#reject-the-document-from-the-system)

    First, check if the received document is a valid invoice or any other document
    that should not be processed in SAP Workflow. If you recognize a document which
    is not an invoice (reminder, advertisement etc.) or the invoice is illegible,
    please move to step 5.2.16.

    If it''s a valid invoice, please check if all following fields were read correctly
    by the OCR system:

    1.  **Recipient number** *-- Kod Spolecnosti*

    2.  **Sender number** -- *Cislo dodavatele*

    3.  **Bank details** *-- Kod Banky dodavatele/Cislo bankovniho uctu dodavatele/dodavatel
    -- cislo IBAN*

    4.  **Total amount** *-- Castka celkem*

    5.  **Tax amount** *-- Castka DPH*

    6.  **Reference number + VAT** *-- Referencni cislo + VAT*

    7.  **Reference number** *- Referencni cislo*

    8.  **Document date** *-- Datum dokumentu*

    9.  **Date of taxable supply** *-- Datum DUZP*

    10. **VAT Rate** *-- Sazba DPH*

    11. **Currency** *- Mena*

    12. **Tax code (for PO invoices only)**

    13. **Purchase order number (for PO invoices only)**'

      3. Return to validation tool and delete the displayed document with multiple
      invoices from the system.'
    question: What should be done if there are two or more invoices in one PDF file?
  - answer: 'If the received document is a valid invoice, the following fields should
      be checked if read correctly by the OCR system: Recipient number, Sender number,
      Bank details, Total amount, Tax amount, Reference number + VAT, Reference number,
      Document date, Date of taxable supply, VAT Rate, Currency, Tax code (for PO
      invoices only), and Purchase order number (for PO invoices only).'
    question: What fields should be checked if the received document is a valid invoice?
  - answer: If important information is missing in an invoice, put "1" as the total
      amount and delete the tax amount to ensure that the invoice is forwarded to
      accountants for manual verification and not processed automatically.
    question: What should be done if important information is missing in an invoice?
- context: 'Once a week you should check and correct the interface errors and rejections.
    To do it, please login to SAP (described in step [5.2.17 Complete data and trigger
    workflow](#complete-data-and-trigger-workflow)) and follow the below steps.

    1.  **Error verification:**

    Open transaction **/n/OTX/PF03_WP** -- it shows all documents that were scanned
    and are prepared for validation:

    Choose option "Error" in the left-hand menu.

    **Note:** You will see errors for all company codes and countries, so you need
    to sort the records by country based on document type:

    Select all the lines for Czech Republic by highlighting them:

    Click on "choose Bulk Action":

    Use "change status" option:

    Change it for 71 by double clicking on the line:

    After selecting the new status, a confirmation will be shown:\

    This action wil trigger a request to the sender to resubmit the errorous items
    once again for scanning/OCR.

    **NOTE!** After sixth attempt to restart the document in the system it must be
    rejected and scanned one more time -- in this case please send an e-mail to xxx@Client.com
    mentioning the Reg ID.

    **NOTE!** If you find a document in status **75** (not error but document is frozen
    in the system) -- see "Status" column - you can change the status to 74 istead
    of 71.

    2.  **Rejections**

    In transaction **/n/OTX/PF03_WP** switch to "Rejected":

    Filter Czech items only, by clicking on funnel button and selecting two following
    criteria from the Column Set: (Document type and Date of Registration).

    Next, click on "Define Values":

    Put the "**\*CZ\***" as document type and date range between current date and
    date of previous verification (excluding that date) to avoid overlapping the date
    ranges. For example: if previous check was done for date range 03.04.2023-10.04.2023,
    the next time you should pick 11.04.2023 as starting date.

    Confirm with tick button:

    Sort the generated list of documents by document type:

    For each line, you need to check the description in the Detail Pane: (In case
    you don''t see the item details, please use the button "show detail pane" in the
    upper menu.)

    If the status is "**78**" and description is "**Rejected by administrator**" you
    should not process these items further and move on to the next document.
