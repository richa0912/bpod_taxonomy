    in Busfleet Inventory WD1 tab

    >

    > Last WD Charged out = Total count of Can be invoiced (column K) from BACKLOG
    tab

    >

    > Last WD Beginning Inventory = Total count in Fleet Inventory Last WD tab + Total
    count in Busfleet Inventory last WD tab

    >

    > New Inventory = Follow step 2.8

    Below is the screen shot of BACKLOG tab that shows the count.

    8.  To update the volume for New Inventory, in Fleet Inventory WD1 tab and Busfleet
    inventory WD1 tab put filter in Create Date(column K) and select only current
    month dated line items(in this case May month), the total count will be the new
    inventory. Highlight these items with a color, this is going to feed the data
    for CSA Unit Report.

    9.  Update the total count into New Inventory column. This should bring the difference
    amount down to zero. But in this case still there is a difference of 130 units.
    If such scenario comes, follow the next step. If not directly move to step 2.13.

    10. Compare Fleet Inventory WD1 and last WD tabs. Perform a Vlookup on these tabs
    to pull the matching VIN numbers.

    11. Perform the above step for busfleet inventory tab as well.

    12. Calculate the total of matched VIN numbers from both the tabs. Update the
    New Inventory column with this new count. This will bring the difference to zero
    value.

    13. Go to BACKLOG tab, for customers those have units on hold during the month
    end a supporting should be attached. This supporting will be the email follow
    ups done for those units. Attach the email in column N (Backup Documentation)
    as back up.
