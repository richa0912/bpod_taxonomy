- context: '> **[Retail Accounting Customer Invoice Maintenance(RACI)]{.ul}** : There

    the filed to update is the completion or delivery date. If the customer is based
    upon delivery, the delivery date must be updated. This is the date, the unit was
    delivered to final destination. If the customer is based upon completion, then
    the completion date field must be updated with the date the unit was completed
    as contracted by Client. The [A/R account number]{.ul} should be verified. The
    [Customer P.O number]{.ul} should match with what''ss on customer''s purchase
    order. [Customer ID]{.ul} should be verified with the invoice suffix numbers.
    The Invoice Suffix are specific to customers. This suffix must be set up with
    every address change or new Parent-Child relationship. For example, a state customer
    may have certain municipalities that order from the state contract. Such cases,
    municipality is the customer being invoiced, not the State. Therefore a new suffix
    must be set up for the municipality. This information will be reflected on the
    customer invoice. The [Ship To Address]{.ul} must reflect the vehicle''s final
    destination from Client. For instance, if the truck is left at a dealership,but
    Client is paying the dealer to deliver the truck to a customer, the customer''s
    address is put into the ship to field. This information will be reflected on the
    customer invoice.

    > On the second RACI screen, the fields to update are the [A/R terms]{.ul} and
    the [number of days]{.ul}. If the customer''s A/R terms are based upon delivery,
    ''"B" must be entered. If the customer is based upon completion, then "A" must
    be entered. The top section will show the [due date]{.ul} based upon these terms.
    The next field is the [number of days]{.ul} that the customer has to pay from
    either completion or delivery. For example, if a customer''s payment terms are
    30 days from delivery, 30 is entered next to days from delivery date. The top
    section of this screen shows what will be reflected on the customer invoice. Some
    customer invoices show only the total invoice price with F.E.T, the destination
    charge or the P&D cost. If these fields are being shown, the Invoicing Assistant
    must verify that they are correct.'
