- context: '**PENALTY CANCELLATION-** Penalty cancellation is an activity in which
    the system calculates the penalty/interest on the consultant every day but if
    the client pays on the same date in which the penalty is charged we cancel the
    penalty charged to the consultant.


    We only cancel the penalty 2 and 3 i.e.. Penalty 2 is the penalty which is 15
    days delayed or more and penalty 3 is the penalty which is 25 days delayed or
    more. It''s a daily activity before applying dunning.


    While cancelling the interest we don''t cancel the interest charged to payu or
    card.


    Now to cancel the penalty we go to Client Application \> reports\>custom\>finance
    reports\> penalizari-data paltii facturii (32174).



    After that we select the date a day before as mentioned in the screenshot**.**



    Then a report is generated and we export the file to excel and calculate the days
    as mentioned in below screenshot**.**



    After calculating the days, then we segregate the penalty bucket i.e. penalty
    2 and penalty 3.



    After exporting the file to excel we select the consultant number from the excel
    sheet and search the consultant.


    **[CASE 1]{.ul}**


    Then we select the invoice number and go to ctrl+fin details.


    So as we can see in the below screenshot the penalty is applied to the consultant
    in the same date so we cancel the penalty with the current date.


    To cancel the penalty, we go to transaction tab and click on cancel and the date
    remains the same in which we are cancelling the penalty.


    **[CASE-2]{.ul}**


    In case two we select the consultant number from the excel sheet and search the
    consultant.


    We do the same and go to ctrl+ fin details and as we see in the below screenshot
    the interest calculated id 6.64 whereas the unpaid interest is 6.38 (in the excel
    sheet) which means that the consultant paid more than his amount and the amount
    has covered some part of his interest.


    So here we cancel the invoice before cancelling the interest in the current date
    only and for that we go to the transaction tab to cancel the invoice. Also we
    take the total of all the amounts of the movements i.e. 66.43+5.57=72.


    After canceling the transaction, we cancel the interest as shown in the below
    screenshot.


    After cancelling the interest, we need to allocate the same transaction again
    with the same amount i.e. 72. While allocating we need to be sure about selecting
    the right movement with the current date only**.**


    **[Case 3]{.ul}**


    In case two we select the consultant number from the excel sheet and search the
    consultant.


    We do the same and go to ctrl+ fin details and as we see in the below screenshot
    the interest calculated id 51.10 whereas the unpaid interest is 51.01 (in the
    excel sheet) which means that the consultant paid more than his amount and the
    amount has covered some part of his interest.


    So here we cancel the invoice before cancelling the interest in the current date
    only and for that we go to the transaction tab to cancel the invoice. Also, we
    take the total of all the amounts of the movements i.e. 552.


    When we select the transaction tab we see that the transaction was allocated from
    unmatched receipts and therefore we don''t cancel the penalty here .

    We go to unmatched of the same date i.e. the date for which we are cancelling
    the penalty and we select the transaction of the same amount and cancel the transaction
    from the right side transaction tab.


    After that we cancel the interest as shown in the below screenshot.


    And after that we allocate the amount to the same consultant.'

  - answer: To cancel the penalty we go to Client Application \> reports\>custom\>finance
      reports\> penalizari-data paltii facturii (32174).
    question: Where do we go to cancel the penalty?
  - answer: 'Three cases for penalty cancellation once consultant number is selected
      from the excel are:


      Case 1: When the penalty is applied to the consultant in the same date so cancel
      the penalty with the current date.

      To cancel the penalty, go to transaction tab and click on cancel and the date
      remains the same in which we are cancelling the penalty.


      Case 2: When the consultant paid more than his amount and the amount has covered
      some part of his interest.

      Here cancel the invoice before cancelling the interest in the current date only
      and for that we go to the transaction tab to cancel the invoice. Also we take
      the total of all the amounts of the movements. After canceling the transaction,
      we cancel the interest. After cancelling the interest, we need to allocate the
      same transaction again with the same amount. While allocating we need to be
      sure about selecting the right movement with the current date only.


      Case 3: When the consultant paid more than his amount and the amount has covered
      some part of his interest for transaction with unmatched receipts.

      Here we cancel the invoice before cancelling the interest in the current date
      only and for that we go to the transaction tab to cancel the invoice. Also,
      we take the total of all the amounts of the movements. When we select the transaction
      tab we see that the transaction was allocated from unmatched receipts and therefore
      we don''t cancel the penalty here . We go to unmatched of the same date i.e.
      the date for which we are cancelling the penalty and we select the transaction
      of the same amount and cancel the transaction from the right side transaction
      tab. After that we cancel the interest and allocate the amount to the same consultant.'
    question: What are the three cases of penalty cancellation for consultant
- context: '**[COD (CASH ON DELIVERY)]{.ul}**


    Now next collector is Cargus (It is the collector for Cash on delivery). The file
    related to Cargus has been uploaded automatically in TOS bank payments through
    VPN.


    It is important to note that the Cargus has specific thing that it is imported
    with the current date for ex- if we check the unmatched transactions from Client
    Application we should select the current date and the movement to see unmatched
    transactions in Client Application under Cargus is 2316 unknown Bank Pay (Cargus).


    There is possibility that in unmatched transactions there is no description of
    the consultant as mentioned in the below screen shot



    So every time Cargus send the details file in which all payment related with Cargus
    are there for that particular date



    So, in this case we will open the file got from Cargus and search the consultant
    via amounts.



    Then we will try to find out the consultant through the details mentioned in the
    file sent by Cargus and search the consultant in Client Application. Also, we
    can cross check the details of the Client Application with the file received from
    Cargus to make sure that we are paying the right consultant.



    In Cargus the processing date of the unmatched transaction should be same as the
    date of file.


    Now we need to allocate the amount to the consultant with correct date as well
    as with correct move type as mentioned in the below screenshots.



    [Cheque (ING online)]{.ul}


    Now another collector we have in Romania is Cheque collector.


    To process this collector, we need to log in to ING online website so that we
    can download the statement from bank website as mentioned in the below screenshot.



    After downloading the statement, we should save the file in EXP format in the
    common oriflamme share drive and save it as mentioned in the below screen shot:



    Now we will copy the same file and save import in the Client Application \>TOS
    folder under common share drive so that the file will upload to the Client Application.


    So, the procedure to upload the file under common share drive remains the same
    as mentioned in the above steps.


    After Importing the file in the share drive we will go to the Client Application
    in TOS \>files \>click on payments from bank then process the file as mentioned
    in the below screenshot:



    And after clicking on process we should make sure that we select the correct move
    type before processing the transactions and the correct move types as well as
    correct date for this collector as mentioned in the below screen shot.



    This collector''s payment should be allocated with one date before the current
    date and also after clicking on process a pop will come which says that the file
    is successfully processed.



    Now go to the unmatched receipts to check the unmatched transactions and we should
    select the correct move type so that all unmatched transactions related to this
    collector will reflect.


    Move type -- 2304 unknown bank pay (CEC).



    So, every time we have to be particular about dates because whatever date we will
    select Client Application will show the unmatched transactions related to that
    date. Go to the unmatched receipts select date and click on read to


    Check the unmatched transaction and follow the same procedure for incoming payment
    processing as mentioned earlier .'
  questions_and_answers:

    question: What is the name of collector for Cash on Delivery?
  - answer: 'Every time Cargus send the details file in which all payment related
      with Cargus are there for that particular date. So, in this case when there
      is no description of the consultant in unmatched transactions, open the file
      received from Cargus and search the consultant via amounts.


      Then try to find out the consultant through the details mentioned in the file
      sent by Cargus and search the consultant in Client Application. Also, cross
      check the details of the Client Application with the file received from Cargus
      to make sure that right consultant is paid.'
    question: How to handle the case of missing consultant description in unmatched
      transactions?

      receipts select date and click on Read to check the unmatched transaction and
      follow the same procedure for incoming payment processing'
    question: How to process the Cheque collector in Romania Incomings
- context: '3.Next collector is ROBO (BRD) Collector and again and there is an automatic
    sync of bank statements to Client Application .We must follow the same procedure
    in order to post the incoming payments.


    Go to the TOS\> bank payments in Client Application and check if we have file
    with the name BRDEROBU as mentioned in the below screenshot.


    Now we need to verify whether all the transactions are matched or not. We will
    go to the unmatched receipts\>select the dates and in the transaction tab select
    the move type for BRDEROBU i.e.


    2317 unknown bank pay (robot) and click on read as mentioned in the below screenshot
    and allocate the payments as per the information provided.



    So, to allocate the payment to the consultant we need to the same procedure as
    mentioned earlier.


    Go to Find Order and search the consultant as per the details mentioned in the
    unmatched transaction and pay the amount to the consultant as per the information
    provided as mentioned in the below screen shot.


    And as per the information allocate the payments with correct move types and date
    i.e. **one day before the actual date**.



    4\. Now next collector is QIWI and again there is an automatic sync of bank statements
    to Client Application we must follow the same procedure of incomings.


    Go to the TOS\> bank payments in Client Application and check if we have file
    with the name QIWI as mentioned in the below screenshot. Now we need to verify
    whether all the transactions are matched or not.



    Movements:


    For debt- 2015 Bank to Invoice (QIWI)


    For interest -- 2115 Bank to Interest (QIWI)


    For Prepayment -2215 Bank to prepayment (QIWI)


    In this cash collector, we pay the whole amount received from consultant in just
    one invoice. We need no to allocate the amounts to the different invoices. For
    ex -- if we have received 250 RON from consultant and when we open the consultant
    in the Client Application we found three invoices of the consultant are not paid
    so in this case also we must allocate the whole amount in the invoice mentioned
    in the unmatched transaction. In case if there is no invoice number we can put
    the whole amount in the last opened invoice of the consultant.


    5.Next collector we have is ORPOSTA (Romanian POST). It is also a cash collector.
    Again there is an automatic sync of bank statements to Client Application we must
    follow the same procedure of incomings.



    After checking the files on TOS, we need to verify whether all the transactions
    are matched or not . For that we need select the unmatched receipts option from
    Client Application and see if we have some transactions in the unmatched.



    In this bank, there is a possibility that we receive some backdate transactions
    as mentioned in the below screen shot:



    As in the upper screenshot we can see that the there are two transactions related
    to the date 15-03-2017 but if we see the rest of the transactions are with the
    date 20-03-2017.


    So, in this case we should reallocate the amounts with the date of the file. We
    need to cancel the transactions with the previous date (15-03-2017) and again
    we need to book the transactions with the date mentioned in the bank statement
    i.e. (20-03-2017)."'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: 'The movements in collector QIWI are as following:


      For debt- 2015 Bank to Invoice (QIWI)


      For interest -- 2115 Bank to Interest (QIWI)


      For Prepayment -2215 Bank to prepayment (QIWI)'
    question: What are the movements for collector QIWI?
  - answer: Backdated transactions should be reallocated with the date of the file.
