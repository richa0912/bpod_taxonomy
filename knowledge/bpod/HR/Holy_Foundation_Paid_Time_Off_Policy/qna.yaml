document_outline: The  Holy Foundation Paid Time Off (PTO) policy is designed for
  all caregivers of the Facility who work the full-time equivalent of 50% or more
  (0.5 FTE), excluding those with specific time off plans related to their roles.
  The purpose of this policy is to provide paid time off for absences, allowing caregivers
  to maintain an appropriate work-life balance.

- context: '4. Paid Time Off Cash Out. Accrued PTO will not be cashed out, except
    upon termination (subject to Separation of Employment policy) or a status change
    to less than .5 FTE.

    5. Paid Time Off Accrual Balances

    A. Each caregiver''s cumulative PTO balance will appear on the caregiver''s pay
    statement and is accessible through the timekeeping system. It is the responsibility
    of each caregiver to identify any potential discrepancy in the amount that appears
    on the pay statement and bring this to the attention of the Payroll Department
    as soon as possible.

    B. Each caregiver''s PTO balance is subject to a maximum accrual of 1.5 times
    their annual accrual rate. For example, a staff caregiver with seven years earns
    30 days per year. They can carry a PTO balance of up to 45 days. Accruals will
    stop when the maximum limit is reached. The caregiver''s accrual will resume when
    time off has been taken and the balance falls below the maximum.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: The PTO balance for caregivers under Holy Foundation Paid Time Off policy
      is determined by their annual accrual rate, which is based on their years of
      service. For example, a staff caregiver with seven years earns 30 days per year,
      allowing them to carry a PTO balance of up to 45 days. Accruals stop when the
      maximum limit is reached, and resume when time off has been taken and the balance
      falls below the maximum.
    question: How is the PTO balance for caregivers determined under Holy Foundation
      Paid Time Off policy?
  - answer: according to Holy Foundation Paid Time Off policy, accrued PTO will not
      be cashed out unless the caregiver's status changes to less than 0.5 FTE or
      they are terminated, subject to the Separation of Employment policy.
    question: What happens to accrued PTO when a caregiver's status changes to less
      than 0.5 FTE or when they are terminated according to Holy Foundation Paid Time
      Off policy?
  - answer: under Holy Foundation Paid Time Off policy, caregivers can check their
      PTO balance on their pay statement and through the timekeeping system. If they
      notice any potential discrepancy, they should bring it to the attention of the
      Payroll Department as soon as possible.
    question: How can caregivers check their PTO balance and address any discrepancies
      under Holy Foundation Paid Time Off policy?
- context: '6. Paid Time Off in Connection with Short-Term Disability, Workers'' Compensation
    & Paid Parental Leave. PTO can be used to cover the waiting periods for both short-term
    disability and workers'' compensation leaves. PTO can also be used to supplement
    short-term disability, workers'' compensation benefits, or Paid Parental Leave
    to 100% of base pay for the life of the claim or until PTO is exhausted, but no
    longer than six months from the first date of disability (any PTO hours remaining
    will be available upon return to work or will be cashed out upon termination per
    policy).

    7. Reemployment. For purposes of PTO accrual rates, caregivers will receive credit
    for length of service for time worked at other ministries in accordance with the
    Reemployment policy.

    8. Holidays. Caregivers are required to use PTO for holiday observances in accordance
    with applicable policy. If accrued PTO is available, it must be used before unpaid
    time can be reported.
