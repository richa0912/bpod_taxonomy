document_outline: The Holy Foundation's Time Away for Providers Policy outlines guidelines
  for eligible providers to accrue and use time away for planned and unplanned absences,
  maintaining work-life balance and complying with legal requirements. Eligible providers
  earn front-loaded time away hours annually, with up to 40 hours carryover. Time
  away is not a vested benefit and cannot be cashed out upon separation. Providers
  can use time away for short-term disability and workers' compensation leaves, and
  holidays are to be observed using time away, except when worked with prior approval.

- context: '4. Separation. Time away is not a vested benefit and, as a result, has
    no cash value. Therefore, unused time away balances will not be cashed out upon
    separation of employment.

    5. Time Away Balances. Time away balances will appear on pay statements. It is
    the responsibility of each provider to identify any potential discrepancy in the
    amount that appears on the pay statement and bring this to the attention of human
    resources as soon as possible.

    6. Short-Term Disability and Workers'' Compensation. Time away can be used to
    cover the waiting periods for both short-term disability and workers'' compensation
    leaves. Time away can also be used to supplement short-term disability or workers''
    compensation benefits to 100% of base pay for the life of the claim or until time
    away is exhausted.'

    8. Holidays. If available, time away is to be used for holiday observances.

    A. Holidays on a Non-Scheduled Work Day. Time away is not applied when working
    on a designated holiday. For example, a provider regularly scheduled to work Tuesday
    through Friday would not be required to use time away if the holiday is observed
    on a Monday.

    B. Holidays on Scheduled Work Days: A provider scheduled to work the designated
    holiday but requesting the day off will be required to use time away. If a caregiver
    chooses to work a holiday, with prior approval, no time away time will be used
    and the day will be recorded as a regular work day.

    Policy Name: Time Away for Providers

    Scope: All time away-eligible providers (non-shift-based physicians and advanced
    practice providers) of the facility.

    Purpose: To establish the facility policy and expectations for providers who accrue
    time away for planned and unplanned absences.

    Policy:

    In keeping with our mission and values, the facility provides eligible providers
    time away subject to the limits and conditions described below. Time away allows
    providers to maintain appropriate work-life balance by offering time off for vacation,
    holidays, personal days and/or sick time or any other reason required by law.
    This policy does not replace the need for the provider to communicate the need
    for time off. This policy does not preclude or preempt any federal, state or municipal
    sick leave law requirements. Caregivers should refer to those specific policies/guidelines
    for additional information.

    1. Time Away. Eligible providers with a full-time equivalent (FTE) of 0.5 or greater
    are eligible for time away: 174 hours for Express Care providers; 264 hours for
    all others. Time away hours will be front-loaded each year on January 1. The time
    granted will be prorated based on FTE status (if less than 1.0 FTE) and date of
    eligibility. Up to 40 hours of time away can be carried over to the next year.
    The rollover of 40 hours is based on FTE (e.g., a .5 FTE will have up to 20 hours
    rolled over from one year to the next; if the provider only has 15 hours, all
    15 hours will roll over). Time Away balances may be adjusted as appropriate if
    a provider''s FTE status changes during the year.'
