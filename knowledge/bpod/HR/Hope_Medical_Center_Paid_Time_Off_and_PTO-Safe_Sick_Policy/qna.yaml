- context: 'A caregiver will continue to accrue PTO while out on PTO or on approved
    short-term disability leave.

    1. Non-exempt (Hourly) Caregivers. Non-exempt caregivers will earn PTO each pay
    period based on their actual hours worked in the previous two weeks. However,
    PTO will not be earned on any hours exceeding a 1.0 FTE status (40 hours per pay
    week).

    2. Exempt (Salaried) Caregivers. Exempt full-time and part-time caregivers accrue
    PTO based on their assigned full-time equivalent (FTE).

    B. Recording Time Off

    1. Non-exempt (Hourly) Caregivers. PTO hours taken should be recorded in the appropriate
    increments that match the caregiver''s regular work schedule and time taken. For
    example, a non-exempt caregiver who regularly works eight hours per day and takes
    a full day off, would record eight hours of PTO for the missed day. Partial day
    absences must be recorded in at least 15-minute increments.

    2. Exempt (Salaried) Caregivers. Exempt caregivers should record PTO in full day
    FTE increments only.'
