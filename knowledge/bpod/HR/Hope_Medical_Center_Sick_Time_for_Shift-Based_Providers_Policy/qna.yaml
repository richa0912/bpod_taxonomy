- context: '2. Sick Time Accrual: Providers accrue 1 hour of sick time per 30 hours
    worked up to maximum of 108 hours. Accruals will stop when the maximum limit is
    reached. The caregiver''s accrual will resume when sick time has been taken and
    the balance falls below the maximum.

    3. Availability: Sick hours become available for use once the accrual shows in
    the sick time bank.

    4. Use of Sick Leave: The use of sick time is optional. When requesting a leave
    of absence, the caregiver will be asked if they would like to use any available
    sick time. If yes, available sick time will be applied by the third-party administrator.
    Sick leave may be used for:

    A. Illness or injury of a full day of the caregiver or family member (as defined
    under FMLA or state leaves).

    B. During the seven-day waiting period before short-term disability benefits begin.

    C. Supplementing short-term disability (STD), paid parental leave and/or workers''
    compensation benefits to 100% of base pay when the claim is reduced to 66-2/3%
    benefit for the life of the claim or until sick time is exhausted, but no longer
    than six months from the beginning of the leave.

    D. Time missed for an approved federal or state intermittent leave.

    E. Reasons protected under municipal, and state paid sick leave.

    F. Providers may only request sick time to replace regularly scheduled hours,
    not to exceed their normally scheduled work week hours.'

    providers should only record sick time when taken in full day increments.

    7. Separation: Sick leave is not a vested benefit and, as a result, has no cash
    value. Therefore, unused sick time balances will not be cashed out upon separation
    of employment.

    8. Sick Time Balances: Sick time balances will appear on pay statements and in
    the timekeeping system. It is the responsibility of each provider to identify
    any potential discrepancy in the amount that appears on the pay statement and
    bring this to the attention of human resources as soon as possible.

    9. Reinstatement/Rehire: Providers rehired or reinstated will have paid sick front-loaded
    into their sick time bank, prorated based on FTE and date of reinstatement/rehire.'
