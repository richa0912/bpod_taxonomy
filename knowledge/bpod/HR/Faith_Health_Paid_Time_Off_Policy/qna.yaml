    \ to use accrued PTO for planned and unplanned time off. An exception to this\
    \ requirement is when a caregiver lives in a state with a state disability insurance\
    \ (SDI) and/or paid family leave (PFL) where the law allows them the choice on\
    \ whether they want to use their PTO or go unpaid. PTO requests should be made\
    \ as much in advance as possible and approved in accordance with departmental\
    \ procedures. Core leaders may approve or deny time off requests based on department\
    \ needs and work requirements. Caregivers are encouraged to appropriately plan\
    \ the use of their PTO accrual to ensure available PTO remains in their accrual\
    \ bank for absences due to illness and observed holidays.\nB.\tWhen two or more\
    \ caregivers request PTO at the same time for the same period and both requests\
    \ cannot be granted, in most instances, the requests will be subject to their\

    \ may be asked to postpone their scheduled PTO days.\nD.\tTo the extent permitted\
    \ by applicable law, caregivers are required to use accrued PTO time before requesting\
    \ any unpaid time off (except in the case of the short-term disability wait period).\
    \ When accrued PTO is exhausted, any remaining time off will be unpaid.\nE.\t\
    Caregivers may only request PTO to replace regularly scheduled hours, not to exceed\
    \ their normally scheduled work week hours.\nF.\tPTO is paid through the normal\

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Caregivers are required to use accrued PTO for planned and unplanned time
      off. An exception to this requirement is when a caregiver lives in a state with
      a state disability insurance (SDI) and/or paid family leave (PFL) where the
      law allows them the choice on whether they want to use their PTO or go unpaid.
    question: What is the exception to use accrued PTO for planned and unplanned time
      off?
  - answer: When two or more caregivers request PTO at the same time for the same
      period and both requests cannot be granted, in most instances, the requests
      will be subject to their core leader's determination.
    question: What happens when two or more caregivers request PTO at the same time?
  - answer: PTO is paid through the normal payroll cycle for actual hours taken in
      that pay period. PTO is normally paid at the caregiver's base rate of pay and
      may include shift differential or other premium pay depending on ministry policy
      and practice. Advance PTO payments are not allowed.

      disability, workers' compensation benefits, or Paid Parental Leave to 100% of
      base pay for the life of the claim or until PTO is exhausted, but no longer
      than six months from the first date of disability (any PTO hours remaining will
