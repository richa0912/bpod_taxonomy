    based on length of service starting with the date of eligibility. Time becomes
    available for use, with core leader approval, once the accrual shows in the PTO
    bank on the last day of each pay period. On each subsequent pay period, 1/26th
    (or 1/27th if appropriate for the year) of the annual PTO hours, per the accrual
    schedule, will be added to each caregiver''s PTO balance. This balance will be
    reduced each pay period for any PTO hours recorded.


    > Note: The initial pay period accrual may be pro-rated based on actual date of
    hire and the final pay period may be pro-rated based on actual date of termination.
    A caregiver will continue to accrue PTO while out on paid leave.
