  Policy'
seed_examples:
- context: '1. Time Away. Eligible medical residents with a full-time equivalent (FTE)
    of 0.5 or greater are eligible for time away. 200 time away hours will be front-loaded
    each year on July 1. The time granted will be prorated based on FTE status (if
    less than 1.0 FTE) and date of eligibility. Up to 40 hours of time away can be
    carried over to the next year. The rollover of 40 hours is based on FTE (e.g.,
    a .5 FTE will have up to 20 hours rolled over from one year to the next; if the
    provider only has 15 hours, all 15 hours will roll over).

    2. Recording Time Off. Time away may be taken in hourly increments. Exempt medical
    residents should only record time away when taken in full day increments.

    3. Time Away Scheduling and Usage

    A. Medical residents are encouraged to use time away for planned and unplanned
    time off. Time away requests should be made as much in advance as possible and
    approved in accordance with departmental procedures. Requests for time away may
    be approved or denied based on department needs and work requirements. If the
    reason for the time away request falls under a federal, state and municipal sick
    leave law, notice/approval requirements may vary. Medical residents are encouraged
    to appropriately plan the use of their time away to ensure sufficient paid time
    is available for absences due to incidental illness and observed holidays.

    B. When two or more medical residents request time away at the same time for the
    same period, and both requests cannot be granted, the requests will be subject
    to their core leader''s determination unless the reason for the time away request
    falls under a federal, state or municipal sick leave law which may require that
    the provider be allowed time away regardless of staffing needs.'
  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: If both requests cannot be granted, the requests will be subject to the
      core leader's determination unless the reason for the time away request falls
      under a federal, state, or municipal sick leave law, which may require that
      the provider be allowed time away regardless of staffing needs under Hope Medical
      Center's Time Away for Medical Residents Policy.

    question: How much time away can be carried over to the next year in Hope Medical
      Center's Time Away for Medical Residents Policy?
- context: '4. Separation. Time away is not a vested benefit and, as a result, has
    no cash value. Therefore, unused time away balances will not be cashed out upon
    separation of employment.

    5. Time Away Balances. Time away balances will appear on pay statements. It is
    the responsibility of each medical resident to identify any potential discrepancy
    in the amount that appears on the pay statement and bring this to the attention
    of human resources as soon as possible.

    6. Short-Term Disability and Workers'' Compensation. Time away can be used to
    cover the waiting periods for both short-term disability and workers'' compensation
    leaves. Time away can also be used to supplement short-term disability or workers''
    compensation benefits to 100% of base pay for the life of the claim or until time
    away is exhausted.

    7. Reinstatement/Rehire. Medical residents rehired or reinstated will have the
    time away days frontloaded into their time away bank, prorated based on FTE and
    date of reinstatement/rehire.'
