    \ (FTE) of 0.5 or greater are eligible for time away. 200 time away hours will\
    \ be front-loaded each year on July 1. The time granted will be prorated based\
    \ on FTE status (if less than 1.0 FTE) and date of eligibility. Up to 40 hours\
    \ of time away can be carried over to the next year. The rollover of 40 hours\
    \ is based on FTE (e.g., a .5 FTE will have up to 20 hours rolled over from one\
    \ year to the next; if the provider only has 15 hours, all 15 hours will roll\
    \ over).\n2.\tRecording Time Off. Time away may be taken in hourly increments.\

- context: "3.\tTime Away Scheduling and Usage\nA.\tMedical residents are encouraged\
    \ to use time away for planned and unplanned time off. Time away requests should\
    \ be made as much in advance as possible and approved in accordance with departmental\
    \ procedures. Requests for time away may be approved or denied based on department\
    \ needs and work requirements. If the reason for the time away request falls under\
    \ a federal, state and municipal sick leave law, notice/approval requirements\
    \ may vary. Medical residents are encouraged to appropriately plan the use of\
    \ their time away to ensure sufficient paid time is available for absences due\
    \ to incidental illness and observed holidays. \nB.\tWhen two or more medical\
    \ residents request time away at the same time for the same period, and both requests\
    \ cannot be granted, the requests will be subject to their core leader's determination\
    \ unless the reason for the time away request falls under a federal, state or\
    \ municipal sick leave law which may require that the provider be allowed time\
    \ away regardless of staffing needs.\nC.\tOccasionally, due to business necessity,\
    \ medical residents may be asked to postpone their scheduled time away days. \n\
    D.\tTo the extent permitted by applicable law, medical residents are required\
    \ to use time away hours before requesting any unpaid time off (except in the\
    \ case of the short-term disability waiting period). \nE.\tMedical residents may\
    \ only request time away to replace regularly scheduled hours, not to exceed their\
    \ normally scheduled work hours.\nF.\tTime away is paid through the normal payroll\
    \ cycle for actual hours taken in that pay period. Advance time away payments\
    \ are not allowed. Pay continues when the medical resident takes time off until\
    \ the time away bank is exhausted. Work Relative Value Unit (RVU) credit is not\
    \ given for time away days."
