document_outline: The Holy Foundation's Jury Duty policy supports caregivers in fulfilling
  their civic obligations by serving on jury duty. Eligible caregivers receive pay
  for hours they are scheduled to work but unable to due to jury duty. Caregivers
  must report jury duty notice to their core leader and coordinate their absence.
  Only actual time spent on jury duty is eligible for pay, and travel time and expenses
  are not covered. The core leader records jury duty hours, and caregivers may retain
  any jury duty pay or remuneration received from the court.
