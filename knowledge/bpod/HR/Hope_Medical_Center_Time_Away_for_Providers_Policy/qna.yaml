- context: '3. Time Away Scheduling and Usage

    A. Providers are encouraged to use time away for planned and unplanned time off.
    Time away requests should be made as much in advance as possible and approved
    in accordance with departmental procedures. Requests for time away may be approved
    or denied based on department needs and work requirements. If the reason for the
    time away request falls under a federal, state and municipal sick leave law, notice/approval
    requirements may vary. Providers are encouraged to appropriately plan the use
    of their time away to ensure sufficient paid time is available for absences due
    to incidental illness and observed holidays.

    B. When two or more providers request time away at the same time for the same
    period, and both requests cannot be granted, the requests will be subject to their
    core leader''s determination unless the reason for the time away request falls
    under a federal, state or municipal sick leave law which may require that the
    provider be allowed time away regardless of staffing needs.

    C. Occasionally, due to business necessity, providers may be asked to postpone
    their scheduled time away days.

    D. To the extent permitted by applicable law, providers are required to use time
    away hours before requesting any unpaid time off (except in the case of the short-term
    disability waiting period).

    E. Providers may only request time away to replace regularly scheduled hours,
    not to exceed their normally scheduled work hours.

    F. Time away is paid through the normal payroll cycle for actual hours taken in
    that pay period. Advance time away payments are not allowed. Pay continues when
    the provider takes time off until the time away bank is exhausted. Work Relative
    Value Unit (RVU) credit is not given for time away days.'
